# Budget files

`PLAN.md` Milestone 42. There is one file per shipped target:
`windows.toml` and `headless.toml`. `rustnative bench --target <target>`
measures the target and compares the results with its file. With `--check`,
the command fails when a measurement is over budget, just as a failing test
fails the build. CI runs it on every push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, job
`budgets`).

```toml
target = "windows"

[budget]
cold_start_ms = { max = 450, tolerance = 0.75 }
build_time_clean_s = { max = 300, tolerance = 0.5, optional = true }
```

Each key has these fields:

- `max`: the budget.
- `tolerance`: the declared noise of that measurement, as a fraction of `max`.
- `optional`: `true` marks a key that is measured only on request.

A measurement fails when it is above `max × (1 + tolerance)`.

The run also fails in two other cases:

- **Unbudgeted.** A measurement has no key in the file, so the file cannot
  fall behind what is measured.
- **Unmeasured.** A key is not measured and not `optional`.

Each run writes `target/budget-report.json`.

## Keys

All scenarios run from `examples/bench-app`, built in release. A key's value
is the median over the scenario's repeated runs. `--low-end` pins the
scenarios to one core (on Windows through `SetProcessAffinityMask`; CI runs
the headless ones under `taskset -c 0`).

### Startup (Windows)

The startup phases come from the `framework_core::perf` phase model
(`C62`). Each is measured from the process's creation time
(`GetProcessTimes`). The screen is a form: a heading, a counter, and forty
labelled text fields, 125 native controls in all.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `runtime_ready_ms` | the backend is initialized and can create windows |
| `first_frame_ms` | the first window exists with its tree realized |
| `first_content_ms` | the first window's first paint |
| `interactive_ms`, `cold_start_ms` | the first idle after the first paint: the application answers input at once |
| `resident_memory_mb` | the working set once interactive |
| `artifact_size_kb` | `bench-app.exe`, release |

### Frames and input (Windows)

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `frame_time_p50_ms`, `frame_time_p99_ms`, `frame_time_max_ms` | intervals between animation frames while a 900 ms size transition runs repeatedly, over 3.2 s |
| `input_latency_ms`, `input_latency_max_ms` | a `BM_CLICK` posted to the real button window, timed until the change it causes is realized on the native controls (median and worst of 31) |

### Headless

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `launch_ms` | launching the bench screen on the headless backend and settling it |
| `input_latency_ms` | a click through hit-testing and the input path, to the settled change |

### Shared core and compile steps (both targets)

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tree_diff_us_1k_nodes` | diffing two thousand-label trees that differ in ten |
| `layout_us_1k_nodes` | laying out a thousand labels |
| `render_us_1k_nodes` | an event re-rendering a component of a thousand rows |
| `rsx_compile_ms_per_kloc` | lowering about a thousand lines of `.rsx` with `framework_markup::compile`: the markup's build-time cost |
| `class_resolve_us` | resolving a nine-class string against the default vocabulary: the style spelling's build-time cost |

### Build time (`--build-times`)

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `build_time_clean_s` | `cargo build -p hello-label` in an empty target folder |
| `build_time_incremental_s` | the same after the application's main file is saved again |

## Owed with their backends

These keys are declared by the plan but have no file yet. Each belongs to a
target that does not exist yet:

- **Web**: per-route client payload, largest content paint, interaction
  responsiveness, and layout shift (`C42-4`).
- **Edge**: per-request cold start and CPU time per route.
- **Server**: container image size.
- **Embedded**: RAM, flash, and boot-to-first-frame (`C83-2`).
- **Devices**: the low-end device matrix.

## Changing a budget

A budget is changed in the same commit as the change that moves it. The
commit says why. The measured values are recorded next to each key, as
comments.
