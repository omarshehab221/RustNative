//! Standalone reproduction of the `DeleteObject`/font anomaly found while
//! debugging `framework-windows`'s `ControlStyle` GDI tests.
//!
//! Deliberately has no dependency on this workspace's own crates and is a
//! plain binary, not a `cargo test` target — the point is to run in a
//! process of its own, so that anything specific to the test-harness
//! process (a debugger, an injected accessibility/overlay/AV hook on
//! `gdi32.dll`, etc.) is ruled out rather than assumed away.
//!
//! Run with `cargo run -p gdi-font-diagnostic`. It prints this process's
//! ID first so you can also watch it in Task Manager's "Details" tab
//! (enable the "GDI objects" column) or in Process Explorer while it's
//! paused at the end, before pressing Enter to let it exit.
