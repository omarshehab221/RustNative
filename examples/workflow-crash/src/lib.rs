//! A workflow killed mid-step completes with each step executed exactly
//! once (`PLAN.md` Milestone 56's first "done when").
//!
//! The order workflow reserves stock, charges, and ships. Each step's
//! effect is a row in `effects`, written in the same transaction as the
//! step's journal entry. The binary runs the workflow and, when told to,
//! kills its own process: after a step, or in the middle of one before it
//! commits. When the binary runs again the workflow resumes, and the
//! effects table shows each step once.
