# Gap plan — from the matrix to the roadmap

[`parity-matrix.md`](parity-matrix.md) says where we stand. This document says
what to build, in what order, and why that order.

It does not restate the backend work already in `PLAN.md` sections 8 and 9.
Everything here is either missing from the plan entirely, or present only as a
bullet under "eventually" when the analysis says it decides adoption.

## The sequencing rule that governs everything below

**Anything that is a per-backend obligation must land before the second
backend exists.** A conformance suite, a capability shape, a layout property,
or an embedding contract costs once when there is one backend and N times when
there are N. This is the same argument `PLAN.md` 2.4 makes about widening
contracts rather than adding conditionals, applied to schedule instead of
structure.

Everything else is ordered by what it unblocks.

## Four tiers

```text
Tier 0  before the second backend      — per-backend obligations and the seams
Tier 1  alongside the backend work     — the loop, the guarantees, the budgets
Tier 2  before any public release      — the application layer users expect,
                                         and responsiveness under load
Tier 3  with and after the web track   — the server, deployment, ecosystem,
                                         reconciliation beyond the screen,
                                         durable execution, and surfaces
```

Tiers are not strict phases: Tier 1 runs continuously the way `PLAN.md`
section 9 does. Milestone numbers below are identities, not an order —
`PLAN.md` section 8 already establishes that convention.

---

# Tier 0 — Before the second backend

## Milestone 53 — The markup syntax

**Why.** `foundations.md` F3.5: a markup surface is how the largest population
of UI developers arrives at a framework at all, and it decays into a trap
unless its equality with the builder surface is enforced by a test. Carried as
a source dialect — the form that population already writes — it carries a
second obligation: the compile step must be invisible in use. It is Tier 0
because the authoring surface is what every later example, template, guide,
doc test, and conformance case is written in — retrofitting a second syntax
through that corpus later costs more than every other Tier 0 item, and grows
with each backend.

**Covers.** `X-L3-8`, `X-L3-9`, `X-L3-10`, `X-L3-11`.

**Scope.**

- `X-L3-8` **Capability equality by construction.** Markup is a compile-time
  front end that lowers to builder calls and nothing else; every node kind is
  an element, every builder method or style field an attribute, `..expr`
  reaches any `Node -> Node` function including an application's own
  extensions, and `{expr}` splices any builder expression into markup. An
  equivalence suite asserts both spellings of every node kind and modifier are
  equal values, with the markup compiled through both carriers.
- **One grammar, two carriers.** `.rsx` files, where an element is an
  expression written anywhere Rust accepts one, for code that is mostly UI;
  and `rsx!`, for markup in `.rs` files, crates without a build step, and
  runnable documentation. The `.rsx` compile step only wraps markup in
  `rsx!`, so parsing, lowering, and diagnostics exist once, and the no-bare-text
  rule keeps the grammar identical in both.
- Structural constructs markup is good at — conditional and repeated children,
  fragments, component elements with typed props (their context inferred from
  the enclosing function in `.rsx` files, named explicitly in `rsx!`) —
  without narrowing the builder form to match, or the reverse.
- `X-L3-9` Diagnostics at compiler quality, held by a compile-failure suite
  run through both carriers.
- `X-L3-10`, `X-L3-11` Tooling parity and an invisible compile step:
  diagnostics from `rustnative build`, `check`, and `test` reported at the
  `.rsx` source; a language-server proxy mapping positions both ways; a
  whole-file formatter; an expansion view; source-map round trips under test.
- Both syntaxes in every document, template, and doc example, side by side;
  project templates that require a choice rather than defaulting to one.

**Done when.** The equivalence suite covers every node kind and modifier
through both carriers, the diagnostics suite covers every listed error through
both carriers, a `.rsx` diagnostic lands at its source position in the CLI and
the editor, both templates build, and no documented example exists in only one
syntax.

## Milestone 58 — The style spellings

**Why.** `foundations.md` F3.4: the cascading styling model splits cleanly into
a declaration vocabulary — the most widely known way to express a style — and a
resolution mechanism this framework already has its own version of. Taking the
first without the second gives the familiar spelling at the cost of a parser;
taking both would put a second engine against our own per-node resolution on
every host. The utility archetype already made that split, which is why it, and
not a stylesheet, is what a host-native framework can carry. It is Tier 0 on two
counts: it is an authoring surface, so Milestone 53's corpus argument applies
unchanged, and the per-property capability table and unit mapping it defines are
per-backend obligations of exactly the kind this tier exists to land early.

**Covers.** `X-L3-12`, `X-L3-13`, `X-L3-14`, `X-L3-15`, `X-L3-16`, the
resolution half of `X-L3-7`; concept `C22-4`.

**Scope.**

- `X-L3-13` A declaration vocabulary in a `framework-style` crate — values,
  units, arithmetic, colour functions and spaces, token references — parsed at
  build time, with no selector, specificity, or cascade admitted at any point,
  and every property mapped to exactly one typed style or layout property.
- `X-L3-12` **Vocabulary equality by construction.** The utility layer is a
  compile-time front end emitting typed properties, so it cannot carry a style
  the typed spelling lacks; an equivalence suite asserts both spellings resolve
  to equal values, an unresolvable class is a compile error naming the property
  it expected, and an expansion command prints what a class string became.
  Compatibility target and version are stated rather than implied, and the
  default token set is vendored under its own licence and pinned.
- `X-L3-14` Token-valued declarations resolved at resolution time, so theme,
  colour-scheme, and palette changes re-apply to existing host objects without a
  rebuild or a tree pass — and so a design-token export and a hand-written theme
  are the same artifact (`X-L3-7`, with Milestone 48 supplying the pipeline).
- `X-L3-15`, `X-L3-16` Per-backend style capability tables and unit mappings,
  asserted by conformance (Milestone 41 thereafter): an unavailable property
  fails the build rather than vanishing, and the cell-quantized mapping is
  stated with its rounding rule rather than chosen in one backend's source.
- `C22-4` State, colour-scheme, and size-class variants bound to mechanisms that
  already exist — Milestone 21's state variants and Milestone 39's size classes
  — with container-relative and relational variants deferred explicitly rather
  than implied.
- Both style spellings in every document, example, template, and component
  entry, on the same terms as the two syntaxes.

**Done when.** The equivalence suite covers every documented style property in
both spellings, an unknown class and an unrealizable property each fail the
build with a spanned diagnostic, a token change re-themes a running application
on Windows, and every backend's capability table and unit mapping is recorded.

## Milestone 39 — Portable-surface obligations

**Why.** Three archetype families fail in the same place: a portable API shaped
by the first host it was written for (`desktop.md` D6, D10; `mobile.md` M3).
The cost of fixing it rises with each backend.

**Covers.** `D-PT-1`, `D-PT-2`, `D-TW-1`, `X-L3-3`, `M-OB-1`, `M-OB-3`,
`X-L5-2`, `X-L4-4`, `X-L1-2`, `X-L0-5`, `X-L0-6`; concepts `C15-1`–`C15-3`,
`C20-1`–`C20-2`, `C21-1`, `C22-1`–`C22-2`, `C24-1`–`C24-2`, `C49-1`, `C65-1`,
`C68-1` (shape).

**Scope.**

- A desktop-class affordance audit of the portable API — window management,
  menus, shortcut maps, hover and cursors, drag-and-drop, multi-window state —
  each expressed as a capability rather than assumed present.
- A reverse audit: which parts of the current API encode a Windows assumption,
  resolved by widening the contract (2.4), not by conditionals.
- Right-to-left as a layout-model property: start/end throughout, mirroring
  applied by the core, with the backend applying host mirroring where it has
  it.
- Safe areas, display cutouts, foldable hinges, and split-screen as layout
  properties.
- Permission states as a capability enum (not-asked, granted, limited, denied,
  permanently-denied) with a portable request flow.
- A gesture arbitration contract describing how our recognizers coexist with a
  host's.
- Per-target panic and teardown policy, thread-affinity enforcement, one
  ownership module per backend, and the escape-hatch contract, all written down
  as the rules a new backend is held to.
- Seven structural decisions from the concept survey, each of which fixes how
  every later backend is written:
  - `C15` a typed, subtree-overridable **environment** carrying host traits
    (theme, locale, direction, text scale, size class, colour scheme, reduced
    motion, posture) and services, fed by every backend, plus upward
    preferences;
  - `C20` a portable **command** type bound by menus, toolbars, shortcuts, and
    host-level surfaces, routed through the focus chain per host convention;
  - `C22` **adaptive-layout** vocabulary in the layout model — size classes per
    axis and container-relative decisions — with posture and hinge geometry as
    environment values;
  - `C24` **per-property native mappers** as the structure every backend uses
    to apply properties to host objects, customizable by applications;
  - `C49-1` the **surface vocabulary** — widget, live activity, tile, extension,
    instant application, companion device, tray extra, jump list, taskbar
    progress — as capabilities, so each backend answers it from the start;
  - `C65` **platform-group crates** (Apple hosts, draw-list hosts) with trait
    contracts their members implement, decided before a second member exists;
  - `C68` the **shape of capability grants** — *may this part of the
    application use it?* — distinct from availability, so services are
    obtainable only through a scoped grant (enforcement in Milestone 51).
- `C21` typestate adopted as a design rule and review checklist for framework
  APIs.

**Done when.** A new-backend conformance checklist exists, the Windows backend
passes it, and each item names the test that proves it — including the
environment, command, mapper, and grant contracts, each exercised on Windows.

## Milestone 40 — Interoperability and incremental adoption

**Why.** The one asymmetry that runs against us is accumulated ecosystem
(`method-and-stack.md`), and the only strategy that has ever beaten it is being
usable *inside* what already exists. Every archetype that grew fast grew this
way. It is Tier 0 because embedding constrains how a backend realizes its root,
and retrofitting it means rewriting each backend's root.

**Covers.** `X-INTEROP-1`, `D-LG-1`, `D-LG-2`, `M-AS-1`, `M-AS-2`, `M-MP-1`,
`M-MP-2`, `D-GX-1`, `M-EN-1`, `W-CL-2`, `W-MS-1`, `E-HAL-1`; concepts `C43-1`,
`C66-1`.

**Scope.**

- `X-INTEROP-1` **Embedding, both directions.** Our tree realized into a
  caller-supplied host window, view, or DOM node; and a foreign host object
  adopted as a leaf of our tree, laid out and clipped by our layout model.
- Library-only mode: application model, state, scheduler, services, and data
  layer compiled into an existing native application through a generated typed
  interface, with no UI dependency.
- Surface handoff: a node owning a host-native rendering surface, with
  documented lifetime, resize, DPI, and present semantics.
- Guest-runtime mode: our runtime driven from someone else's `main` and
  initialization, owning neither startup nor the loop (required for vendor
  embedded SDKs and for mounting inside an existing HTTP service).
- A documented adoption ladder — library, embedded subtree, full application —
  with a worked example at each rung.
- `C66` one annotated interface description of the library-only surface —
  ownership and threading explicit — from which bindings for each host
  language are generated and tested, instead of hand-written per language.
- `C43` export of a RustNative component as a web custom element with typed
  attributes, DOM events, and preserved accessibility relationships — the web
  rung of the adoption ladder.

**Done when.** A sample existing application on each shipped backend hosts a
RustNative subtree, and a sample RustNative application hosts a foreign
control, both under test.

# Tier 1 — Alongside the backend work

These run continuously, like `PLAN.md` section 9, and each new backend is
expected to satisfy them as part of being called complete.

## Milestone 41 — Guarantees and conformance suites

**Why.** Our root-layer advantages (`foundations.md` F0.4, F1.4, F2.1, F3.3)
are currently implementation properties, not guarantees. An unproven guarantee
is marketing; a tested one is a moat. This milestone converts each one.

**Covers.** `X-L3-1`, `X-L3-2`, `X-L3-4`, `X-L3-6`, `X-L3-8`, `X-L2-1`,
`X-L2-2`, `X-L1-1`, `X-L1-4`, `X-L0-2`, `X-L5-1`, `W-FG-1`, `D-FP-1`,
`D-FP-2`, `M-FP-1`, `D-WV-1`, `D-SD-2`, `X-L2-3`; concept `C09-1`.

**Scope.**

- Syntax equivalence as a standing guarantee: the suite Milestone 53 creates
  lives here permanently, so a node kind or modifier added in one syntax only
  fails the build.
- A documented invalidation contract with tests that fail on
  over-invalidation, plus render-cause tracing that names the state, prop,
  resource, or effect responsible.
- The transient-state fast path (2.10) as a contract with tests.
- Scope-bound cancellation as a public guarantee: no task observes or mutates
  state after its owner unmounts, proven per target.
- Native-object lifetime as a guarantee, with leak detection as a CI gate.
- Host-object reuse and modal-operation conformance (resize, menu tracking,
  native dialogs, drag loops) per backend.
- A fidelity conformance checklist per backend, measured against the host's own
  first-party applications.
- A text conformance suite: complex scripts, bidirectional text, grapheme
  clusters and emoji sequences, font fallback, spaceless line breaking, caret
  and selection geometry.
- A layout conformance suite at multiple text scales with pseudo-localized
  strings, asserting no clipping, overlap, or lost targets.
- Accessibility assertions in CI plus a recorded screen-reader pass per
  backend.
- The published comparison methodology and results against self-drawing and
  webview archetypes.
- `C09` the batching guarantee as a tested property: every state change caused
  by one message becomes visible in the same render, and no render observes a
  partial set.

**Done when.** Each guarantee has a named test, and no backend is called
complete without passing the suite.

## Milestone 42 — Budgets

**Why.** Every performance claim in this analysis is an assertion until it is
measured, and the archetypes we beat on footprint (`web.md` W3, W10, W11;
`desktop.md` D7a; `mobile.md` M3) are beaten only with numbers.

**Covers.** `X-L0-1`, `X-L0-3`, `W-RS-1`, `W-RS-2`, `W-SL-1`, `W-ED-2`,
`M-BR-2`, `D-WS-1`, `E-GUI-4`, `W-SH-1`, `M-OB-4`; concepts `C42-4`,
`C62-1`, `C62-2`, `C83-2`.

**Scope.** Declared per-target budgets — cold start, resident memory, artifact
size, frame-time distribution including worst case, input latency, per-route
client payload, serverless cold start, edge CPU time per route, embedded RAM
and flash, container image size, and build time — measured in CI on every
commit, on a low-end reference device or profile where one exists, with
regressions failing the build and the numbers published. The concept survey
adds three kinds of budget the list above misses: user-centric web metrics —
largest content paint, interaction responsiveness, and layout shift, with zero
layout shift for framework-controlled content (`C42-4`); a startup *phase*
model traced on every backend — process start, runtime ready, first frame,
first content, interactive — with each phase budgeted and optional
profile-guided release builds (`C62`); and boot-to-first-frame on embedded
reference boards (`C83-2`).

**Done when.** A budget file exists per target, CI enforces it, and the public
documentation quotes the measured numbers rather than adjectives.

## Milestone 43 — The developer loop

**Why.** Our substrate's one structural disadvantage (`foundations.md` F7), and
the pillar most cited in framework selection. No competitor will fix it for us.

**Covers.** `X-L7-1`, `X-L7-2`, `M-BR-4`, `E-PR-1`; concepts `C55-1`–`C55-2`,
`C56-1`, `C57-1`, `C58-1`–`C58-3`, `C59-1`, `C90-1`.

**Scope.** Rebuild-and-restart with application state preserved from a
serialized snapshot, against a declared wall-clock budget; optional dynamic
library reload for the application crate where the platform allows; the loop
working on-device for mobile and embedded, not only on the development machine;
board and device quickstart in one command including flashing, logging, and
restart; and a measured first-hour target — project creation to running on a
device in three commands or fewer.

The concept survey supplies the mechanisms that make that loop competitive
rather than merely fast:

- `C55` **previews and a catalogue**: components rendered in isolation across a
  configuration matrix (theme, locale and pseudo-locale, text scale, size
  class, direction, contrast), in both syntaxes, on the development machine's
  backend and on the headless backend;
- `C59` **development builds** per device target, loading the application crate
  as a separately rebuilt unit so a change reaches the device without
  reinstalling or re-signing;
- `C58` **development services** derived from declared bindings, a continuous
  test mode, and an in-application **error overlay** on every backend pointing
  at source positions, including `.rsx` positions;
- `C57` **`rustnative generate`** for components with their preview and test,
  screens wired into navigation, services, and server resources;
- `C56` a structural editing API on the markup language server, so a visual
  designer can be built without a second model;
- `C90` on-demand installation of toolchains and board support.

**Done when.** The loop's wall-clock time is in the budget file (M42) and is
met on every shipped backend.

## Milestone 44 — Inspection and diagnostics

**Why.** Dynamic substrates get inspection from reflection; we must expose it
deliberately. `PLAN.md` section 9 lists it as "eventually add", which
understates what it decides.

**Covers.** `X-L7-3`, `X-L7-4`, `X-L3-5`, `D-IM-1`, `E-RS-2`; concepts
`C04-2`, `C18-2`, `C24-2`, `C61-1`–`C61-3`, `C88-1`, `C92-1`.

**Scope.** A runtime inspection protocol — declarative tree, realized host
objects and their mapping, state and props (readable and editable), layout with
per-node explanation, event and render tracing, task and scope inspection, host
object lifetimes — over a transport that works locally, on-device, and
remotely; an inspector client shipped with the CLI; an in-application overlay
on the draw-list path for hosts without a second screen; and a reduced form
using deferred host-side formatting for constrained targets.

From the concept survey: `C61` **record, replay, and time travel** — input,
messages, and service responses recorded with redaction rules, replayed
deterministically on the headless and originating backends, stepped backwards
in the inspector, and convertible into a regression test — which message-only
state change and replaceable clock and executor make attainable here in a way
ambient-mutation frameworks cannot match; device recordings that include
sensor and service inputs and replay in the simulator (`C88`); render-or-skip
reasons per component (`C04-2`), property-value provenance (`C18-2`), active
mapper customizations (`C24-2`); and scheduler and task events in existing
embedded trace formats (`C92`).

**Done when.** Every backend answers the protocol, including terminal and
embedded in reduced form.

## Milestone 45 — Test infrastructure

**Why.** `PLAN.md` 2.13 caps verification at what hardware we have. A headless
backend lifts most of that cap for everything above L2, and it is the
prerequisite for testing the application layer built in Tier 2.

**Covers.** `X-L7-5`, `X-L7-6`, `X-L7-7`, `X-L7-8`, `M-OB-2`, `M-OB-4`,
`E-GUI-2`; concepts `C11-1`, `C11-2`, `C14-1`, `C55-3`, `C60-1`, `C60-2`,
`C82-1`.

**Scope.** A headless reference backend realizing the tree into an inspectable
model; synthetic input dispatched through the real input path; a deterministic
test clock and executor; golden and visual regression tests over realized
output; a lifecycle conformance suite (process death and restoration,
configuration changes, deep-link entry during restoration, low-memory trim); a
device and emulator matrix in CI; and a host-side device simulator for
display-bearing embedded profiles.

From the concept survey: `C60` a **test query API over the portable
accessibility tree** — by role, accessible name, label, and state — so every UI
test is also an accessibility check and survives refactoring; `C11` an
**exhaustive test mode** in which an unasserted task, effect, or outgoing
message fails the test, with per-test dependency overrides; `C55-3` every
preview doubling as a golden test; `C14-1` a kill-and-restore test for each
destination's saved state; and `C82` a **hardware-in-the-loop runner** across
emulators, the simulator, and connected boards, whose per-board results are the
only basis for a "supported board" claim.

**Done when.** Component, interaction, and golden tests for the full
application layer run on a machine with none of the target hardware.

---

# Tier 2 — Before any public release

The application layer every competing archetype has and we do not. These are
the reasons commercial software picks a framework.

## Milestone 46 — Internationalization and localization

**Why.** The largest single omission in the current plan
(`parity-matrix.md` L5). Every archetype at every maturity level has an answer.
A framework without one is not viable for commercial software, and retrofitting
it touches every string, every layout, and every backend.

**Covers.** `X-L5-3`, `X-L5-4`; concept `C41-2`.

**Scope.** Typed message catalogues with plural and grammatical-gender
categories; compile-time-checked placeholders; locale-aware number, date,
currency, unit, and collation behaviour delegated to host facilities where they
exist; bidirectional text and locale-aware casing; runtime locale switching
that updates the tree; an extraction and merge workflow for translators with
context; pseudo-localization wired into the dev loop and the layout
conformance suite (M41); locale delivered through the environment (`C15`) so a
switch invalidates only readers; and locale-aware web routing with generated
language alternates (`C41-2`).

## Milestone 47 — State, resilience, and data

**Why.** Four **Absent** rows that together are most of what an application
actually does: shared state, error containment, the async data layer, and
forms.

**Covers.** `X-L4-1`, `X-L4-2`, `X-L4-3`, `X-DATA-1`, `X-DATA-2`, `X-DATA-3`,
`W-SF-7`, `M-FP-2`, `M-FP-3`, `D-MC-1`; concepts `C08-1`, `C08-2`, `C09-2`,
`C10-1`, `C10-2`, `C11-2`, `C12-1`, `C12-2`, `C13-1`–`C13-3`, `C14-1`, `C16-1`,
`C17-1`, `C17-2`, `C29-1`, `C29-2`, `C30-1`, `C30-2`, `C31-1`, `C31-2`,
`C34-1`–`C34-3`, `C36-1`, `C87-1`.

**Scope.**

- A shared/scoped state contract — typed, observable, no global mutable state,
  with defined update ordering and the same lifetime discipline as component
  state — plus a state history contract giving undo/redo.
- Error boundaries: a subtree may fail, be contained, present a fallback, and
  be retried, with the failure reported through the diagnostic channel.
- `X-DATA-1` the async data layer: typed queries keyed by identity, declared
  cache lifetimes, deduplication, background revalidation, retries with
  backoff, pagination and infinite scrolling, optimistic updates with rollback,
  and invalidation composed with the component lifecycle.
- `X-DATA-2` offline mutation queueing with a conflict policy.
- `X-DATA-3` schema migration for persisted state, with up/down and a dry run.
- One validation and forms model shared by client and server — one schema, one
  set of messages, checked at compile time — with two-way binding ergonomics,
  dirty tracking, and a submission lifecycle.
- Constrained background work as a portable service contract, and asset/image
  loading with decode, downscale, caching, and lifetime-bound cancellation.

From the concept survey, the details that separate a real application layer
from a list of features:

- **State.** Derived values cached and recomputed only on changed inputs, and
  slice subscription for shared stores (`C08`); a move-based "prepare off the UI
  thread, apply atomically" pattern (`C09-2`); a documented state-machine
  pattern on enums whose entry and exit effects are tied to task scopes, with
  optional diagram generation (`C10`); stream collection bound to component
  scope with stated hot/cold and backpressure semantics (`C12`).
- **Navigation and lifetime.** Navigation state as a typed value from which the
  host navigation stack is reconciled, typed query parameters on the web, and
  per-destination state scope (`C13`); a declared saved-state subset per
  destination written to the host's restoration mechanism (`C14`); service
  scopes per application, window, destination, and request (`C16`), with
  per-test overrides (`C11-2`).
- **Failure.** Error boundaries built as supervision policies — isolate,
  restart with backoff, escalate — on task scopes and subtrees, with a stated
  default that a child's failure does not cancel its siblings (`C17`).
- **Data.** Query results as an exhaustive state type — loading, empty,
  failure, success, stale-while-refreshing — and colocated, batched data
  requirements (`C29`); freshness and retention as separate lifetimes,
  revalidation on focus and reconnect, hierarchical key invalidation, prefetch,
  cancellation when unobserved, and structural sharing (`C30`); live queries
  over local storage and a documented repository pattern with a gap-filling
  paging source (`C31`); an HTTP interceptor chain, certificate pinning, and
  declared endpoint interfaces (`C34`).
- **Forms.** A changeset type — typed casting, per-field errors, storage
  constraint violations mapped to fields, and a validated output type distinct
  from raw input (`C36`, with typestate from `C21`).
- **Long-running work.** A long-running operation primitive — goal, progress
  stream, cancellation, pre-emption, result — bound to a task scope and shown
  by standard progress components (`C87`).

## Milestone 48 — Components, tokens, and visualization

**Why.** Primitives are not a component set, and the design-to-code path is how
applications are actually built (`web.md` W14; `desktop.md` D3).

**Covers.** `X-UI-1`, `X-UI-2` / `X-L3-7`, `X-VIZ-1`, `D-SD-1`, `E-GUI-3`;
concepts `C18-1`, `C19-1`, `C19-2`, `C20-3`, `C22-3`, `C23-1`, `C25-1`,
`C26-1`–`C26-3`, `C27-1`, `C28-1`, `C28-2`.

**Scope.** A component library covering the controls applications need,
realized natively per backend with documented accessibility semantics for each;
a design-token pipeline into the theme system with a documented schema and an
explicit split between semantic roles mapped to host appearance and absolute
brand values, emitting Milestone 58's token file rather than a format of its own
so an exported design system and a hand-written theme are one artifact; charting
and visualization on the draw-list path with an accessible alternative for every
visual encoding; a documented hybrid pattern
for custom-drawn subtrees inside a natively realized tree; and a constrained
text profile declaring which scripts each embedded profile supports.

From the concept survey: a **headless behaviour layer** for composite controls
— list selection, combobox, menu, tabs, tree, grid navigation, date entry —
carrying focus, keyboard, and accessibility semantics independent of
appearance, on which drawn controls and application composites are built
(`C19`); **container-owned typed layout data** for children (`C18-1`); a
**per-host idiom table** for every control (`C23`); an **adaptive navigation**
component and a **command palette** (`C22-3`, `C20-3`); **matched-geometry
transitions** keyed by shared identity (`C25`); non-copying **sort, filter, and
group views**, animated identity diffs, and **sectioned compositional lists**
(`C26`); a **document model** with autosave, versions, recent documents, and
per-document undo bound to commands (`C27`); and **host content controls** —
embedded web content, media playback with system media controls, and camera
preview — plus the pattern for adding more (`C28`).

## Milestone 54 — Responsiveness under load

**Why.** No row in the layer matrix covers what happens when a render is
*expensive*. The concept survey (`concepts-core.md` Part A) shows every mature
framework reached the same answer — prioritized, interruptible, visibility-aware
work — and had to retrofit it. RustNative's pure render, separated effects, and
structured scopes are exactly the preconditions that retrofit needed. It is
Tier 2 because the first data-heavy application will expose its absence, and
the scheduler contract is cheaper to extend before the application layer
(M47) builds on it.

**Covers.** `C01-1`–`C01-4`, `C02-1`–`C02-3`, `C03-1` (contract), `C04-1`,
`C75-1`, `C76-1`.

**Scope.**

- **Update priorities** attached to the message or state change that causes
  them — immediate, normal, deferrable — rather than a second API.
- **Interruptible reconciliation** for deferrable updates: work split at
  component boundaries, yielding to the host between frames, discarded when
  superseded, with the guarantee that one frame never mixes two versions of the
  same state.
- **Deferred values and pending transitions**, so a component keeps showing
  previous content while new content is prepared and can show that it is stale.
- **Render purity enforced by type**: render receives shared access only.
- **Suspendable task scopes** driven by visibility and host lifecycle, with the
  rule for in-flight work stated per task kind, and offscreen subtrees retained
  at the lowest priority.
- **Skipping by props equality**, decided from the props type, with a report
  when a component cannot participate.
- **The change-detection contract** published: which strategy this is, what
  triggers invalidation, what does not.
- **On constrained targets**, the executor running as one task at a declared
  priority under a static-priority system, never above real-time work, and
  frame pacing that stops completely when idle, verified by measured idle
  current.

**Done when.** A reference application filtering a large data set keeps input
latency within its Milestone 42 budget while the filtered view updates, on at
least two backends; a hidden screen performs no periodic work; and an
embedded reference board shows no periodic wake when idle.

# Tier 3 — With and after the web track

## Milestone 49 — The server application model

**Why.** The largest uncontested opening identified anywhere in this analysis
(`web.md` W7): nobody offers a batteries-included application backend in a
compiled, statically typed language with a native UI story attached. It is
Tier 3 because it depends on Web milestone H's render path and on M47's data
and forms work.

**Covers.** `W-SF-1`…`W-SF-6`, `W-MF-1`, `W-EP-1`, `W-MS-1`; concepts
`C05-1`, `C05-2`, `C35-1`, `C35-2`, `C37-1`, `C38-1`, `C39-1`, `C39-2`,
`C40-1`, `C41-1`, `C52-2`, `C54-1` (sending).

**Scope.** A server application model built on the same component, scheduler,
and service contracts as the client — typed request handling, middleware,
sessions, error pages; authentication and authorization with session and token
strategies, password and passkey handling, provider federation, and a typed
policy model; a data layer with compile-time-checked queries, migrations with
up/down and dry run, pooling, and transaction scoping bound to request
lifetime; durable background jobs with retries, backoff, idempotency keys, and
inspection; secure-by-default request handling; a generated administrative
surface derived from schema and policy; typed server functions with one
definition checked at both call sites; layered typed configuration; and
mountability inside an existing compiled-language HTTP service.

From the concept survey: **server-only components** whose code is excluded from
the client build and whose boundary is checked at compile time (`C05`); the
server model built on the **Rust ecosystem's established service and middleware
abstraction** with typed extractors, not a private pipeline (`C37`); an **API
schema derived from handler types** with generated documentation, validation,
clients for other languages, and contract tests (`C35`); **migrations generated
from model changes** (`C38`); **data-layer authorization policies** enforced
for queries and subscriptions alike, and client-side adapters for existing
hosted backends (`C39`); **feature-driven defaults** with a build-time
explanation report (`C40`); **typed per-route web metadata** and generated
sitemaps (`C41-1`); passkey sign-in (`C52-2`); and server-side push sending
(`C54-1`).

## Milestone 50 — Deployment, updates, and fleet operations

**Why.** Shipping and updating is where frameworks are judged after the demo,
and we currently have no answer for updates on any target
(`mobile.md` M3; `embedded.md` E6).

**Covers.** `W-MF-6`, `W-MF-7`, `W-DP-1`, `W-DP-2`, `W-DP-3`, `W-SL-2`,
`W-SL-3`, `W-SL-4`, `W-ED-1`, `W-ED-3`, `W-SH-1`, `M-BR-1`, `E-MW-1`,
`E-MW-2`, `E-BL-1`, `W-IS-1`, `W-IS-3`, `W-HM-1`, `W-HM-2`; concepts
`C42-1`–`C42-3`, `C47-1`, `C47-2`, `C48-1`, `C53-1`, `C63-1`, `C63-2`,
`C64-1`, `C64-2`, `C81-1`, `C89-1` (model payloads).

**Scope.** Deployment adapters as a stable documented contract with local
emulators for each shape; `rustnative deploy` plus export of standard
infrastructure descriptions so existing pipelines consume our output; preview
deployments, staged rollout, and one-command rollback; host-limit capabilities
and request-scoped cancellation on per-request hosts; edge storage and cache
contracts preserving each platform's semantics; container and embedded-Linux
package output; mobile over-the-air updates within each host's rules with
signing, staged rollout, rollback, and version pinning; firmware update with
A/B slots, verification, and automatic rollback, delegating to an existing
bootloader; zero-payload static routes and a progressive-enhancement baseline;
and single-artifact server deployment with embedded assets.

From the concept survey: **native project files as generated outputs** on every
backend, never hand-edited, with a typed configuration-plugin hook for
capability packages (`C63`); a **shared build cache** and **remote build and
signing** — explicitly not counted as verification (`C64`); **immutable
revisions and traffic splitting**, and a startup rule that keeps
snapshot-restore hosts safe (`C47`); **resource bindings** declared in project
metadata and used to derive infrastructure and least-privilege permissions
(`C48`); the web **image and font pipelines** and prefetch on intent (`C42`);
store-delivered **dynamic asset and feature packs** (`C53`); **multi-image
firmware builds and signing** with anti-rollback (`C81`); and **model assets**
as a versioned payload type in the update paths (`C89`).

## Milestone 51 — Observability, security, and compliance

**Why.** What makes a framework acceptable to buyers who never read a benchmark
(`web.md` W9; `desktop.md` D7a; `embedded.md` E3).

**Covers.** `X-OBS-1`, `W-EP-2`, `W-EP-3`, `D-WS-2`, `E-SF-1`, `E-SF-2`,
`E-BL-2`, `E-OB-1`, `E-OB-2`, `E-OB-3`, `E-IOT-1`, `E-AI-1`, `E-RB-1`,
`D-CT-2`; concepts `C67-1`, `C68-1` (enforcement), `C69-1`, `C70-1`, `C77-1`,
`C77-2`, `C78-1`, `C80-1`, `C80-2`, `C89-1` (capabilities).

**Scope.** `X-OBS-1` crash capture with per-target symbolication, structured
logging, metrics, and tracing spanning the client/server boundary, with opt-in
privacy-respecting telemetry and a published data policy, and the ability to
reconstruct the tree state at failure from the inspection protocol; a stated
threat model per target with capability scoping and escape-hatch reach;
generated compliance evidence (dependency inventory and licences, software bill
of materials, accessibility conformance, privacy and permission manifests); a
stated certification posture with requirement traceability maintained as build
output; power-aware scheduling, watchdog integration, safe-state panic paths,
and bounded-allocation mode on embedded profiles; and service contracts for
messaging, provisioning and device identity, bounded-latency inference, and
node-graph transports.

From the concept survey: **capability grants enforced** — services obtainable
only through a scoped grant, and third-party packages receiving only what they
declare (`C68`); an optional **isolated worker process** with a typed message
boundary for applications hosting untrusted content (`C67`); **web security
primitives on by default** — nonce-based content security policy, subresource
integrity, typed dangerous sinks, cross-origin isolation, permissions policy
(`C69`); instrumentation through the **vendor-neutral tracing and metrics
standard** with client-to-server trace propagation (`C70`); **pools, arenas,
and high-water-mark reports** for framework structures on embedded (`C77`); the
framework running **unprivileged or supervised** and recovering state after a
supervised restart (`C78`); a **power-loss-resilient state store** verified by
power-cut testing, and generated partition layouts (`C80`); and accelerator
availability as capability answers (`C89`).

## Milestone 52 — The project around the framework

**Why.** L9 decides whether anything above gets a second project, and two items
here — the stability policy and the machine-readable description — are direct
answers to the loudest complaint about the incumbent archetype and to how a
growing share of code is now written.

**Covers.** `W-MF-8`, `X-DOC-1`, `X-DOC-2`, `X-ECO-1`, `X-ECO-2`, `E-RS-3`,
`E-PR-2`, `D-CT-1`, `E-RS-1`, `E-EC-1`, `E-EC-2`, `E-HAL-2`, `E-K-3`;
concepts `C03-1`, `C57-2`, `C57-3`, `C71-1`, `C71-2`, `C73-1`, `C79-1`.

**Scope.**

- A published stability and deprecation policy with a support window, plus
  automated migration for every breaking change.
- `X-DOC-1` task-oriented guides and a published generated API reference;
  `X-DOC-2` a runnable example per subsystem and per supported board.
- `X-ECO-1` a third-party capability package contract: a community-authored
  service or control implementing a portable contract with per-backend code,
  discoverable and versioned, with no framework fork required.
- `X-ECO-2` a machine-readable description of the framework — component and
  service contracts, capabilities, events, and layout semantics — so
  code-generating tools produce correct code rather than plausible code.
- A stated non-duplication policy for the embedded Rust ecosystem, with the
  `Executor` contract demonstrated against an existing embedded executor,
  subsystem capability mapping for a configuration-driven RTOS ecosystem, and
  peripheral access left to the existing trait ecosystem.
- The one-stack span demonstrated by a single application genuinely built for
  desktop and for a device, and documented core cost characteristics (stack,
  heap, worst-case timing).
- From the concept survey: **codemods** shipped with every breaking release and
  run by `rustnative upgrade` — the mechanism behind the stability promise
  (`C57-2`) — and **feature kits** that generate working, tested
  authentication, commerce, and administration (`C57-3`); **compatibility
  metadata** in every capability package — supported backends, required grants,
  framework version range — with a generated index, and package contributions
  scoped to what the package declares (`C71`); a published **change-detection
  contract** for developers arriving from other strategies (`C03-1`); board
  metadata consumed from existing hardware descriptions (`C73`); and an
  executor and clock adapter for a standard RTOS interface (`C79`).
- The **rejected concepts** recorded in `concepts-delivery.md` `C72` kept
  current, so a declined idea is found rather than re-proposed.

## Milestone 55 — Reconciliation beyond the screen: real time and sync

**Why.** Three concepts the survey surfaced are the framework's own core idea —
declare desired state, reconcile the real thing towards it — applied somewhere
other than a UI tree: local-first data sync between devices and a server
(`C32`), a server-held UI tree reconciled into a browser over a persistent
connection (`C33`), and a device fleet reconciled towards a desired
configuration (`C84`). Each is how its archetype wins (`web.md` W15, W16;
`embedded.md` E10), and each is a place where owning a reconciler is an
advantage rather than an implementation detail.

**Covers.** `C07-1`, `C32-1`–`C32-3`, `C33-1`–`C33-3`, `C84-1`, `C85-1`,
`C85-2`.

**Scope.**

- **Sync.** A sync service contract — local-first reads and writes, background
  replication, server push, partial replication, and a declared conflict policy
  per collection — with at least one adapter; optional conflict-free replicated
  types for collaboration, with merge functions property-tested; schema
  versioning across clients at different application versions.
- **Server-interactive UI.** Per-connection component trees on the server,
  events over a persistent connection, reconciler-produced diffs applied on the
  client, reconnection with state recovery, deployment draining, and optimistic
  client hooks; render mode selectable per subtree (static, server-interactive,
  client-interactive, automatic) with state transfer on switch.
- **Channels and presence** as service contracts usable by every mode.
- **Devices.** A typed desired/reported state contract with on-device
  reconciliation, conflict policy, and offline catch-up, sharing machinery with
  the sync service; messaging with explicit delivery-guarantee, retained-value,
  last-will, and persistent-session semantics; and a mapping between typed
  application state and standard device data models, with commissioning
  delegated to existing stacks.

**Done when.** One collaborative example works offline on two devices and
converges; one server-interactive example survives a reconnect and a deploy;
and one device example converges to a desired configuration after being
offline.

**Depends on** Milestone 47 (data layer), Milestone 49 (server model), Web
milestone H.

## Milestone 56 — Durable and event-driven execution

**Why.** The serverless track (Web milestone K) is request-shaped only, yet most
per-invocation workloads are events, and business processes need execution
that survives restarts (`web.md` W10, W11, W12). Rust async functions are
already state machines, and structured scopes already model step lifetime, so
the determinism durable execution requires can be *enforced by type* rather
than linted for.

**Covers.** `C17-1` (server and device processes), `C44-1`, `C44-2`,
`C45-1`, `C45-2`, `C46-1`, `C87-1` (server side).

**Scope.**

- **Event handlers** as a serverless entry point with a standard event
  envelope, batching, partial-failure reporting, retries, dead-letter routing,
  idempotency keys, and the same invocation-bounded task scope as requests.
- **Durable workflows**: steps with recorded results, replay on restart,
  durable timers, external signals, compensation, and versioning rules for
  in-flight executions — with non-deterministic operations reachable only
  through the workflow context, so a non-deterministic workflow does not
  compile; at least one engine adapter.
- **Stateful actors**: identity, single-instance serialized execution, private
  durable storage, and alarms, with an edge adapter and a single-process local
  implementation for development.
- **Supervision** applied to long-lived server and device processes, and
  long-running operations with progress and cancellation exposed across the
  client/server boundary.

**Done when.** A workflow survives a process kill mid-step and completes
exactly once per step; an event handler processes a batch with partial
failures correctly; and an actor-backed collaborative session works under the
local implementation and one edge adapter.

**Depends on** Web milestone K, Milestone 49.

## Milestone 57 — Surfaces beyond the main window, and product services

**Why.** Cross-platform frameworks are most often abandoned at the point where
an application needs a widget, an extension, push, purchases, or secure storage
and has to drop to native code (`concepts-app.md` Part E). The vocabulary lands
in Milestone 39 so every backend answers it; this milestone realizes it.

**Covers.** `C49-2`, `C49-3`, `C50-1`, `C51-1`, `C52-1`, `C54-1`.

**Scope.**

- **Surfaces.** Widgets and tray or menu-bar extras realized from a restricted
  subset of the portable tree on the backends that have them, with data shared
  with the main application through a declared store; share and action
  extensions receiving typed payloads; and each remaining surface in the
  Milestone 39 vocabulary answered honestly per backend.
- **Push.** Registration, token rotation, topics, rich and actionable
  notifications with actions delivered as messages, and background delivery.
- **Commerce.** Catalogue, purchase, entitlements, restoration, and
  subscription state with per-store adapters and server-side receipt
  validation.
- **Secure storage.** A contract backed by each host's protected store, with
  capability answers for hardware backing and biometric gating.
- **Feature flags and remote configuration**: typed flags with compiled
  defaults, caching, offline behaviour, environment integration, and local
  overrides for development and tests.

**Done when.** A reference mobile application ships a widget, a share
extension, push with actions, an in-application purchase, secure token storage,
and a remotely toggled feature, with no application-authored native code.

**Depends on** Milestone 39 (vocabulary, grants), the relevant backends,
Milestone 49 (server-side validation and sending).

Four concept requirements belong to backend milestones rather than to section
11, and `PLAN.md` carries them there: partial prerendering (`C06-1`) in Web
milestone H; typed peripherals in framework drivers (`C74-1`), asynchronous
display region transfer (`C91-1`), and the direct-to-display embedded Linux
profile (`C83-1`) in Milestone 37. The designer non-goal (`C56-2`) is kept with
the rejected concepts in Milestone 52.

`E-K-1`, `E-K-2`, `X-L1-3`, and `X-L1-5` (the `no_std` core profile, the
non-`Send` executor, and the host clock) are already in `PLAN.md`'s long-range
roadmap as shared core work and remain where they are: before the targets that
need them.

# The differentiation statement

Parity on the matrix is the price of being considered. This is the argument for
being chosen, and every clause is a claim the work above is designed to make
testable rather than rhetorical.

1. **Host-native realization on every target, from one application model.**
   Competitors have one or the other. The ones with host fidelity are
   single-platform; the ones that are portable draw their own widgets and
   inherit a permanent accessibility, input-method, and system-settings deficit
   (`foundations.md` F2.1 versus F2.2). Proven by M41's conformance suites and
   M41's published comparison, not asserted.

2. **No runtime tax anywhere on the range.** One substrate from a browser
   sandbox to a microcontroller, with declared and CI-enforced startup, memory,
   and size budgets (M42). The archetypes that lead on ergonomics cannot follow
   here, because the tax is their substrate.

3. **Correctness properties that are guarantees rather than conventions.**
   Scope-bound task cancellation, deterministic native-object lifetime, typed
   boundaries where competitors serialize, and compile-time checking across the
   client/server seam (M41, M49). Each with a conformance test behind it.

4. **One seam count of one.** UI, state, layout, routing, persistence, data,
   forms, services, packaging, and deployment versioned as one product with one
   stability policy (M46–M52) — answering both the assembly problem and the
   migration complaint that dominates the incumbent's feedback.

5. **Adoptable inside what already exists.** Library, then embedded subtree,
   then application (M40). This is the only clause that addresses the one
   asymmetry running against us, and it is therefore the one that must not slip.

6. **Reconciliation as a general capability, not a UI trick.** The same idea —
   declare desired state, reconcile reality towards it — drives the UI tree,
   local-first data sync, server-interactive UI over a persistent connection,
   and device fleets (M55). Every competing archetype owns one of those; none
   owns the mechanism that unifies them. This clause is only as strong as the
   concept survey's claim that they are one mechanism, and M55's done-when
   criteria are what test it.
