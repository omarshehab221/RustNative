# Parity matrix — where RustNative stands

Scored with the rules in [`method-and-stack.md`](method-and-stack.md):
**Met** (shipped, verified on real hardware, regression-tested), **Partial**
(shipped for some targets or cases), **Planned** (specified in `PLAN.md` at
implementable depth, not built), **Absent** (not specified anywhere).

Evidence is `PLAN.md` sections and milestones and `BUILD_STATUS.md` records.
"Verified" means `PLAN.md` 2.13's meaning: run on the real host.

Current reality: Milestones 1–32 complete and verified on Windows/Win32. Every
other backend is **Planned**. Scores below are therefore given as
*core contract* first and *coverage across targets* second, because those two
numbers differ enormously and averaging them would hide the real position.

## Reading the matrix

**Where we are genuinely strong.** L0 through L4 on the core contracts, and L2
through L6 on Windows. The root choices (`foundations.md` F0.4, F1.4, F2.1,
F3.3) are made, implemented, and verified on one host. That is a real
foundation, and it is the expensive half.

**Where the plan is complete but unbuilt.** Every other backend. That is a
scheduling and hardware fact (2.13), not a gap in this analysis's sense, and it
is not what this document is for.

**Where the plan itself is missing something.** Nine items scored **Absent**
that are not backend work and would be missing even if every backend shipped
tomorrow:

1. Localization and internationalization (`X-L5-3`) — the largest single
   omission; no commercial application ships without it.
2. The async data layer (`X-DATA-1`) — the most-used third-party layer in every
   competing ecosystem.
3. The engineering loop: fast iteration and runtime inspection (`X-L7-1`,
   `X-L7-3`) — our substrate's structural disadvantage, currently answered by a
   bullet list under "eventually".
4. Forms and validation (`W-SF-7`).
5. Shared/scoped state (`X-L4-1`) and error boundaries (`X-L4-3`).
6. Updates after ship — mobile OTA and firmware A/B (`M-BR-1`, `E-MW-1`).
7. Performance budgets enforced in CI (`X-L0-1`) — without which every
   performance claim we make is an assertion.
8. The server application model (`W-SF-*`) — the largest uncontested market
   opening identified anywhere in this analysis.
9. Interoperability and incremental adoption (`X-INTEROP-1`) — the only
   strategy that has ever worked against an accumulated ecosystem.

**Where the concept survey adds to that list.** Scoring the concepts separately
exposes gaps the layer view hides, because each is small enough to vanish
inside a larger row:

10. Responsiveness under load — priority lanes, interruptible rendering, and
    work that pauses when invisible (`C01`, `C02`). No row above covers what
    happens when a render is expensive.
11. Reconciliation beyond the screen — local-first sync, server-interactive UI,
    and device desired-state (`C32`, `C33`, `C84`) — absent, and each is the
    framework's core idea applied somewhere new.
12. Event-driven and durable execution (`C44`, `C45`) — the serverless track is
    request-shaped only.
13. Surfaces beyond the main window and the product services around them
    (`C49`–`C54`) — widgets, extensions, push, commerce, flags, secure storage.
14. Seven structural decisions that belong in Tier 0 because they fix how
    every backend is written: the typed environment (`C15`), the command model
    (`C20`), adaptive-layout vocabulary (`C22`), per-property native mappers
    (`C24`), the surface vocabulary (`C49-1`), platform-group crates (`C65`),
    and the shape of capability grants (`C68`).

Those fourteen, plus the conformance suites that turn our root-layer advantages
from claims into tested guarantees, are what [`gap-plan.md`](gap-plan.md)
schedules.
