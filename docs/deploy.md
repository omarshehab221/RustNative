# Deployment, updates, and fleet operations

`PLAN.md` Milestone 50. One application ships in several shapes:

- a Windows desktop package (a ZIP or MSIX);
- a long-lived server;
- a container description.

After it is deployed, it updates.

## The adapter contract

`framework_server::deploy::DeploymentAdapter` covers:

- `deploy` of an immutable `Revision`, which starts as a preview with no
  traffic;
- `promote` to a percentage of traffic;
- `rollback`;
- `status`;
- `limits`: what the host allows each request (deadline, memory, file
  system, payload).

Request scopes end with the response on every target, as Milestone 49
already guarantees.

## A long-lived server

```sh
rustnative deploy local start --port 8080 --control 8081   # the proxy
rustnative deploy local add r1 127.0.0.1:9001              # revision r1 takes all traffic
rustnative deploy local add r2 127.0.0.1:9002              # r2: a preview (header x-revision: r2)
rustnative deploy local promote r2 --percent 10            # 10% of clients
rustnative deploy local promote r2 --percent 100
rustnative deploy local rollback                           # back to r1
rustnative deploy local status
```

- **The proxy.** The `TrafficSplitter` is a reverse proxy built on
  `framework-server`. It sends each client to a revision by a stable hash
  of the client's address, so a client stays on its revision. It marks
  each response with `x-served-by`.
- **Moving traffic.** Promotions and rollbacks move traffic without
  restarting anything.
- **Revisions are immutable.** A name used once cannot be deployed again.
- **Client addresses.** Behind the proxy, every request reaches a revision
  from the proxy's address. The proxy sends the client's address in
  `x-forwarded-for`, replacing any the client sent. A revision's
  per-client rate limit counts the proxy, so turn it off on revisions
  (`Security { rate_limit: None, .. }`). A per-client limit at the proxy is
  owed.

## Container and infrastructure descriptions

```sh
rustnative deploy export container    # Dockerfile (distroless, non-root)
rustnative deploy export compose
rustnative deploy export kubernetes   # Deployment + Service, probes on /healthz and /readyz
rustnative deploy export systemd
```

- **Output.** The descriptions are written to `deploy/`.
- **Least privilege.** Each description asks only for what the
  application declared: the port, the environment variables in
  `rustnative.toml` `[resources]`, a read-only root file system, and a
  non-root user.
- **Building the image.** This needs Docker. `rustnative deploy export
  container --build` runs `docker build` when Docker is installed, and
  says so when it is not.

## Single artifact

A build script calls `framework_build::embed_assets("assets")`, and the
server serves the result with `ServerApp::assets(ASSETS)`.

- **Names.** Each file is named by its content hash and served with
  `cache-control: immutable`.
- **Integrity.** `assets::stylesheet` and `assets::script` write the link
  with its subresource-integrity digest, and the script also carries the
  response's CSP nonce.
- **One file.** The binary is the whole deployment.

## Response caching

A route declares `get(page).public().cached(&["notes"], ttl)`, and
`ServerApp::response_cache().invalidate("notes")` regenerates every page
tagged `notes`. `cache_inspection::<P, Policy>()` serves the cache's state
at `/__cache`.

- **Public only.** Only public routes are cached.
- **No personal data.** A response that sets a cookie is never stored.

## Desktop updates

See `docs/deploy/update-rules.md` for what each host permits.

In `rustnative.toml`:

```toml
[update]
public-key = "…"         # rustnative update keygen prints it
```

The CLI commands:

```sh
rustnative update keygen --out publisher.key
rustnative update manifest --version 1.1.0 --url https://…/demo-1.1.0.zip \
    --package target/package/demo-1.1.0.zip --rollout 10 --key publisher.key > latest.json
```

`rustnative update manifest` refuses a key whose public half is not the
`[update] public-key` in `rustnative.toml`, so a release cannot be signed
with a key the installed application does not trust.

An MSIX installed from a web page or a share updates through App Installer
instead: `rustnative package windows --format msix --appinstaller <url>`
also writes the `.appinstaller` file, which points App Installer at `<url>`
and asks it to check on every launch.

In the application: `Updater::check` reads the manifest, and `stage`
verifies the package and unpacks it beside the running version. `activate`
switches versions atomically. `Launcher` starts the current version and
rolls back one that fails twice before `interactive`.

## Generated native project files

`[package] capabilities = ["internetClient", "webcam"]` in
`rustnative.toml` goes into the MSIX manifest. A capability package
(Milestone 52) declares its own capabilities there the same way (`C63`).

## Build cache

`rustnative build windows --cache` builds through `sccache` when it is
installed (cargo's `build.rustc-wrapper`), so local and CI builds share
compiled crates. It says so and builds without the cache when `sccache` is
not installed (`C64`). Remote build and signing are owed. A remote build
would not count as a verification.

## Owed

- **Other targets.** Static-host, per-request-function, and edge adapters
  and their local emulators are owed with Web milestones J and K. Mobile
  store packs and firmware images are owed with Milestones 35–37.
- **Web loading path** (`C42`), with Web milestone J.
