//! Telling a component that one of its virtual lists needs a different
//! window of items.
//!
//! The renderer works out *that* a list's visible range changed (see
//! `rendering::virtual_list`); this is the one place that turns that into
//! an [`Event::VisibleRangeChanged`] and hands it to the component — the
//! same split the animation subsystem uses, and for the same reason: a
//! dispatch renders, and a renderer must not call back into the thing
//! rendering it.
//!
//! # Why this is a loop rather than a call
//!
//! Answering a range change renders new items, which lays out, which can
//! compute a further range — an item that measured taller than estimated
//! genuinely changes how many fit. That inner pass queues its change
//! instead of dispatching it (`VirtualLists::is_dispatching`), and the loop
//! here picks it up. The loop terminates because each pass either changes
//! no range (done) or realizes the range the previous one asked for, and
//! measurements do not depend on where an item was placed; the cap is a
//! backstop against an application that renders a different item count than
//! it was asked for, not the expected exit.
