//! The canvas window: a child `HWND` that paints a [`DrawList`] with
//! Direct2D.
//!
//! # Where the draw list lives
//!
//! On the window itself, in a [`CanvasState`] owned through
//! `GWLP_USERDATA`. `WM_PAINT` must be answerable without reaching the
//! window's `Runtime` — a paint can be delivered synchronously while the
//! runtime is already borrowed (an `UpdateWindow` during a render), and
//! resolving the runtime again there is exactly the reentrancy this backend
//! forbids. The renderer hands the window its list ([`set_draw_list`]);
//! the window paints whatever it last received.
//!
//! The slot cannot be misread as anything else: `RuntimeSlot::get` only
//! reads windows of the top-level class, and this is not one.
//!
//! # Device loss
//!
//! Direct2D reports a lost device (a driver reset, a remote session
//! reconnecting) as `D2DERR_RECREATE_TARGET` from `EndDraw`. The render
//! target and everything created from it are then discarded and the window
//! invalidated, so the next paint recreates them from the draw list — which
//! is never lost, because it is data, not device state.
