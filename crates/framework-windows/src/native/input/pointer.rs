//! Mouse, touch, and pen input: targeting, pointer capture, hover
//! enter/leave, wheels, and feeding the portable gesture recognizer.
//!
//! # Where the messages come from
//!
//! Mouse messages (`WM_MOUSEMOVE`, `WM_[LRMX]BUTTON*`) and pointer messages
//! (`WM_POINTER*`, which Windows sends for touch and pen) are all *posted*,
//! so the message loop's pre-dispatch pass sees every one of them before it
//! reaches whichever child control is under the pointer — including the
//! system `BUTTON`/`EDIT` classes whose window procedures this crate does
//! not own. That is where all of this runs, and none of it consumes the
//! message: a native button under the pointer still gets its own mouse
//! input and still behaves natively.
//!
//! Mouse input deliberately stays on the classic mouse messages rather than
//! being moved into the pointer stack with `EnableMouseInPointer`: that call
//! is process-global, irreversible, and changes how *standard controls*
//! receive the mouse, which is not a trade a UI framework gets to make on an
//! application's behalf. Touch and pen arrive through `WM_POINTER*`; when
//! Windows then promotes them to compatibility mouse messages, those are
//! recognized by their `GetMessageExtraInfo` signature and skipped, so a tap
//! is delivered once, as touch.
//!
//! # Targeting
//!
//! A sample is delivered to the nearest node — starting from the one whose
//! native window is under the pointer and walking up the declarative tree —
//! that declared pointer (or gesture) interest. While a contact is captured,
//! every sample for it goes to the capturing node instead, in that node's
//! coordinate space, even outside its bounds.
//!
//! # Capture and reentrancy
//!
//! Mouse capture is taken on the **top-level** window, not on the capturing
//! node's own `HWND`: a node may be realized as a system control whose window
//! procedure this crate does not own, and the top-level window is where
//! `WM_CAPTURECHANGED` must arrive for a lost capture to be noticed.
//! `WM_CAPTURECHANGED` is *sent*, synchronously, from inside
//! `SetCapture`/`ReleaseCapture` — which this module calls while the
//! window's `Runtime` is already borrowed. Its handler therefore only posts
//! [`WM_FRAMEWORK_CAPTURE_LOST`] and returns; the posted message is handled
//! on a later, unnested turn of the loop, and checks `GetCapture()` rather
//! than trusting the order messages arrived in.
