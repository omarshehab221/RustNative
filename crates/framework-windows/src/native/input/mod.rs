//! Native input: keyboard translation and focus (Milestone 11), and the
//! advanced input system (Milestone 25) — pointers, capture, wheels,
//! gestures, IME composition, clipboard events, drag-and-drop, and game
//! controllers.
//!
//! Each concern is its own module and owns its own slice of per-window
//! state, gathered in [`InputState`] on the window's `Runtime`. None of them
//! knows about rendering beyond reading the realized tree (to find which
//! node is under a native window and what input it declared), and none of
//! them mutates component state: everything reaches a component as an
//! `Event` through `Runtime::dispatch`.
