//! Milestone 27 native integration tests: animation against real windows.
//!
//! Frames are driven by a [`ManualFrameClock`] and a posted
//! `WM_FRAMEWORK_FRAME`, so every assertion is about an exact moment rather
//! than about whatever the machine managed in the meantime. Everything
//! else is production code: the same renderer, the same timeline, the same
//! message loop. What the tests read back is where Windows actually put the
//! control (`GetWindowRect`) and what alpha it actually has
//! (`GetLayeredWindowAttributes`) — not the framework's own bookkeeping.
