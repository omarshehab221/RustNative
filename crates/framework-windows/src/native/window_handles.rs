//! A small, thread-safe `WindowId -> HWND` table for top-level windows,
//! kept in sync by `WindowRegistry` as windows are created and destroyed.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every other native window/control handle in this crate is confined to
//! the single Win32 message-loop thread and reached through `Runtime`/
//! `WindowRegistry`, which are plain (non-atomic, non-`Send`) structures —
//! correct, because nothing outside that thread ever needs to see them.
//! Native dialogs are the one exception: `services::dialogs` deliberately
//! runs each `IFileDialog` on its own dedicated STA thread (see
//! `services::run_sta`'s doc comment for why), not the message-loop thread,
//! so giving a dialog a real parent/owner window means resolving a
//! `framework_core::WindowId` to a native handle from a *different* thread
//! than the one that owns it.
//!
//! This closes exactly the gap `Audit.md`'s Phase 3 roadmap item 15
//! describes: `FileDialogRequest::owner` (in `framework-core`) carries a
//! window identity as far as the platform boundary, and this module is
//! what lets `services::dialogs` turn that identity into a real `HWND` it
//! can pass to `IFileDialog::Show` — without needing the STA thread to
//! reach into `WindowRegistry`/`Runtime` at all, which would reintroduce
//! exactly the kind of cross-thread raw-pointer sharing the rest of this
//! crate's architecture avoids.
//!
//! # Why a raw `isize`, not `HWND` itself
//!
//! An `HWND` is `windows_sys`' typedef for a raw pointer
//! (`*mut c_void`), which is not `Send`/`Sync` by default. The value
//! itself, though, is Win32's own opaque per-process handle table index —
//! copying the bits to another thread and using them only as an *opaque
//! argument* to a documented Win32/COM API (never dereferencing them as a
//! Rust pointer, never reading through them) is exactly what Win32's own
//! handle model supports; many real applications route `HWND`s to worker
//! threads for exactly this "use as an opaque owner/target" purpose (for
//! example, `PostMessageW`, called from a non-owning thread, is already
//! this crate's own waker mechanism — see `runtime.rs`). Storing the
//! handle as a plain `isize` here documents that distinction explicitly:
//! this table is not claiming the handle is safe to dereference or use for
//! anything beyond being handed back to a Win32/COM call that itself
//! accepts a handle value.
