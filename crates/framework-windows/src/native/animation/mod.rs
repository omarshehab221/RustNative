//! Driving `framework_core`'s [`Timeline`] from real frames, and applying
//! what it produces to native objects.
//!
//! # The loop
//!
//! ```text
//! render / relayout      the renderer notices a transitioned property changed
//!        │               and records what it moved from and to
//!        ▼
//! after_render           those become timeline transitions; the frame driver
//!        │               is started if anything is now animating
//!        ▼
//! WM_FRAMEWORK_FRAME     the driver's posted message: tick the timeline and
//!        │               apply each value to its native object
//!        ▼
//! idle                   nothing animating: the driver stops, the thread sleeps
//! ```
//!
//! No step of that touches a component. A frame changes native properties
//! and nothing else — the declarative tree it was started from is still the
//! tree, and `PLAN.md`'s rule that animation must not rerender holds by
//! construction rather than by care.
//!
//! The one thing that *does* reach a component is an animation ending,
//! which arrives as an ordinary `Event::AnimationFinished` so one animation
//! can lead to the next.
