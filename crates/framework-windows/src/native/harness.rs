//! A bounded driver for the real Win32 message loop, so the native backend
//! can be tested against actual windows.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The standards audit's P1.17 finding is that the most failure-prone code
//! in this crate had no test at all:
//!
//! > The most failure-prone code is: HWND creation; synchronous Win32
//! > callbacks; `GWLP_USERDATA`; reentrancy; menus; modal windows;
//! > destruction ordering; GDI lifetime; COM; clipboard ownership; file
//! > dialogs; scheduler wakeups.
//!
//! and that the fix is real execution rather than a proxy for it:
//!
//! > Where GUI CI is difficult, use a dedicated Windows runner with
//! > deterministic scripted interactions rather than pretending
//! > compile-time tests cover native behavior.
//!
//! The obstacle was never the assertions — it was that `run_application`
//! blocks in `GetMessageW` until `WM_QUIT`, which a test cannot drive.
//! [`NativeHarness`] replaces only that outermost blocking loop with a
//! bounded `PeekMessageW` pump. Everything inside it — window creation,
//! every `WNDPROC`, reconciliation, layout, focus, task pumping, the panic
//! boundary — is the production code path, reached through the same
//! [`message_loop::handle_message`] the real loop calls. A harness with its
//! own dispatch would test the harness.
//!
//! # What these tests are and are not
//!
//! They create genuine top-level `WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW` windows and show
//! them, because that is the thing under test: message-only windows (which
//! `test_support` provides for the narrower unit tests) never receive
//! `WM_SIZE`, never participate in focus, and never own a menu. The
//! consequence is that these tests need an interactive window station —
//! true on a developer's machine and on GitHub's `windows-latest` runner,
//! not true under a service account.
//!
//! # Serialization
//!
//! Rust's test harness runs tests concurrently in one process, and three
//! things here are process-global: the window-class registry, the
//! `WindowId -> HWND` table in `native::window_handles` (which several
//! tests would key with `WindowId::PRIMARY` at once), and the GDI/USER
//! handle quota that the resource-lifecycle test measures against. Every
//! harness therefore takes a process-wide lock for its lifetime, making
//! these tests sequential with respect to each other while leaving the rest
//! of the suite parallel.
