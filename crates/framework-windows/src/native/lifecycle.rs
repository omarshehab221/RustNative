//! The application's life as Windows reports it, and the persisted state
//! that has to be on disk before each step of it.
//!
//! | Windows says | The application hears | State |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `WM_QUERYENDSESSION` (sign-out, shutdown) | `Lifecycle::Terminating` | flushed first |
//! | `WM_POWERBROADCAST` / `PBT_APMSUSPEND` | `Lifecycle::Suspending` | flushed first |
//! | `WM_POWERBROADCAST` / `PBT_APMRESUMEAUTOMATIC` | `Lifecycle::Resuming` | — |
//! | the low-memory resource notification (`native::memory_watch`) | `Lifecycle::LowMemory` | flushed first |
//! | the last window closed (the loop ends) | `Lifecycle::Terminating` | flushed first |
//! | a burst of writes went quiet for [`IDLE_FLUSH`] | nothing | flushed |
//!
//! The idle flush is what bounds how much a crash can lose: a component
//! that saved something a second and a half ago has it on disk, without
//! every keystroke costing a disk write.
//!
//! The primary window's placement (position, size, maximized) is saved in
//! the same store when it closes and restored when it next opens — on the
//! monitor it was on, if that monitor is still there.
