//! Foreign native objects adopted as leaves of the tree (embedding outward,
//! `PLAN.md` Milestone 40): a control the framework did not write, created
//! by a factory the application registered, then measured, laid out,
//! clipped, and destroyed by the framework's own rules.
//!
//! The factory runs on the UI thread when a [`framework_core::Node::foreign`]
//! node of its kind is inserted, and creates the object as a child of the
//! window it is given. The object's accessibility is its own: a system
//! control already answers UI Automation, and the framework neither
//! subclasses it nor changes its tab stop.
