//! The one place this backend turns a raw Win32 handle or a stored raw
//! pointer back into a live Rust reference.
//!
//! # What this module is for
//!
//! The standards audit's P0.2 finding is not that any single dereference in
//! this crate is obviously wrong — it is that *too many* of them were
//! spread across the backend, each re-deriving the same global lifetime
//! argument in its own `SAFETY` comment:
//!
//! > The issue is that too many invariants are global, informal, and
//! > reentrancy-dependent. [...] Native callback code should be designed so
//! > that incorrect lifetime usage is difficult or impossible to express,
//! > rather than relying on hundreds of local safety comments to maintain
//! > one global invariant.
//!
//! The audit compares three fixes and recommends the third:
//!
//! - **A — more comments.** Rejected: does not shrink the unsafe surface.
//! - **B — `NonNull` newtypes plus centralized access.** "A good
//!   intermediate step."
//! - **C — a native context object callbacks resolve through
//!   (`NativeWindowContext::from_hwnd()`), with all raw-pointer
//!   manipulation in a very small module.** Recommended.
//!
//! This module implements both B and C together: [`HostRef`] is the
//! `NonNull` newtype (B) that replaces `Runtime`'s bare `*mut Application`
//! and `*mut WindowRegistry` back-references, and [`with_runtime`] is
//! the callback-facing resolution step (C) that
//! replaces the "read the slot, null-check it, `unsafe { &mut * }` it"
//! sequence every `WNDPROC` arm used to write out by hand.
//!
//! # The invariant, stated once
//!
//! Everything here rests on a small set of facts about this backend's
//! structure, which is why they can be stated once here instead of at every
//! call site:
//!
//! 1. `WindowsPlatform::run` takes `&mut Application` and does not return
//!    until the message loop has exited, so the `Application` outlives
//!    every `Runtime`, every native window, and every message dispatched
//!    to one.
//! 2. `native::app::run_application` owns the single `WindowRegistry` as a
//!    local, and it likewise outlives the message loop it then runs.
//! 3. Each `Runtime` is boxed and inserted into `WindowRegistry::runtimes`,
//!    and is *never removed while the loop runs* — a window that closes is
//!    only marked `destroyed` (see `WindowRegistry`'s type documentation
//!    for why removing it would be a use-after-free against a caller
//!    further up a reentrant call stack). So a `*mut Runtime` published
//!    into `GWLP_USERDATA` at `WM_NCCREATE` stays valid for the whole loop.
//! 4. The Win32 message loop is single-threaded. Win32 can *reenter* it
//!    (a synchronous `SendMessageW` during `CreateWindowExW`, for example),
//!    but it cannot run two dispatches in parallel.
//!
//! Point 4 is the sharp one, and it is why the resolution functions below
//! are **closure-scoped** rather than returning a `&mut Runtime`. A
//! returned reference could be held live across a nested dispatch that
//! resolves the *same* `Runtime` again, producing two live `&mut` to one
//! object — instant undefined behavior, with nothing in the type system to
//! object. Handing the reference to a closure makes the borrow's extent
//! visible in the source instead: whatever reentrancy happens inside `f`,
//! the borrow provably ends when `f` returns.
