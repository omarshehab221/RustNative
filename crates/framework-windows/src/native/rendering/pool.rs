//! Native windows kept between a removal and the insertion that can reuse
//! them.
//!
//! # Why recycling, and only here
//!
//! Scrolling a virtual list removes the items that left the viewport and
//! inserts the ones that entered it — the same controls, one row over.
//! Creating and destroying a `HWND` per row per scroll step is the most
//! expensive thing a Win32 list can do, and it is pure churn: the window
//! that just left is exactly the window the new row wants.
//!
//! So a removal that belongs to a virtual list parks its native object here
//! instead of destroying it, keyed by the parent it lived under and the
//! kind it is, and the matching insertion takes it back. Anything still
//! parked when the render ends is destroyed: the pool never outlives the
//! render that filled it, so a window is either reused immediately or gone.
//!
//! Only virtual-list items are pooled. Recycling silently changes which
//! node a live `HWND` belongs to, which is safe when the two are
//! interchangeable rows of the same list and is not something to do to the
//! rest of a tree on the chance it helps.
//!
//! # Subtrees
//!
//! A pooled container keeps its own content window, and the pool is keyed
//! by parent handle, so the children removed from it are parked under that
//! same handle and are taken back when the container is. A whole item
//! subtree therefore recycles as a unit, in the order the diff already
//! produces: removals deepest-first, insertions shallowest-first.
