//! A container's border and corner radius — the two approximated rows of
//! the Windows style capability table (`framework_style::WINDOWS`).
//!
//! A container is a plain child window this backend paints itself, so it
//! can draw a one-pixel border in the resolved border colour and be clipped
//! to a rounded window region. A native control keeps its system border
//! and shape: drawing either would mean owner-drawing it, which 2.14's
//! fourth rule forbids.
//!
//! Both values live in window properties (`SetPropW`), read back by the
//! container's own `WM_ERASEBKGND` and `WM_SIZE`, which cannot reach the
//! renderer; the container removes them at `WM_NCDESTROY`.
