//! The accessibility adapter: the one place the portable semantic model is
//! projected onto Win32.
//!
//! # What this closes
//!
//! The standards audit's P1.16 finding is that `framework-core` had a
//! perfectly good portable semantic model — role, name, description,
//! focusability — and the Windows backend consumed exactly one field of it:
//!
//! > The Windows backend currently relies heavily on the default semantics
//! > of native controls. [...] portable semantic data existing in Rust is
//! > not the same thing as platform accessibility being correct.
//!
//! `AccessibilityInfo::name_hint` and `description_hint` reached no Win32
//! API at all, so a button whose visible text was an icon or an
//! abbreviation announced that text and nothing else, and a node's declared
//! `AccessibilityRole` had no effect on what assistive technology reported.
//!
//! # What it does, and the boundary it draws
//!
//! The audit's instruction is to "define an explicit accessibility adapter
//! boundary now, even if the full UI Automation provider remains future
//! work". That boundary is [`AccessibilityBridge`]: realization code hands
//! it a node and an HWND and knows nothing else about accessibility, and
//! this module knows nothing about control creation, styling, or layout.
//!
//! Two mechanisms sit behind it:
//!
//! 1. **Keyboard focusability**, as the `WS_TABSTOP` window style. Applied
//!    symmetrically — a node that stops being focusable has the bit
//!    *removed*, which the audit specifically calls out as previously
//!    missing ("does not symmetrically remove native focus styles when
//!    focusability changes").
//! 2. **Name, description, and role**, through Microsoft's Dynamic
//!    Annotation API (`IAccPropServices`). This is the supported way to
//!    override the accessible properties of a *standard* control without
//!    writing a full provider: the control keeps its own native
//!    implementation and behavior, and the annotation supersedes individual
//!    properties on it. Annotations are addressed by
//!    `(HWND, OBJID_CLIENT, CHILDID_SELF)`, so they follow the window and
//!    are cleared when it is destroyed.
//!
//! A full UI Automation provider — which is what custom, non-`HWND`-backed
//! semantic nodes will eventually need — remains future work, exactly as
//! the audit allows. What is no longer true is that the portable model is
//! decorative.
//!
//! # Degradation
//!
//! Everything here is best effort by design. `IAccPropServices` needs COM
//! on the calling thread; if it is unavailable (COM initialization failed,
//! the object could not be created), annotation is skipped and controls
//! fall back to their native defaults — which is the behavior this backend
//! had before this module existed. An application never fails to start,
//! and no control ever fails to appear, because an annotation could not be
//! applied.
