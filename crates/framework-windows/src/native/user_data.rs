//! Centralizes every read and write of a window's `GWLP_USERDATA` slot
//! behind two narrow, typed accessors.
//!
//! Before this module existed, `GetWindowLongPtrW`/`SetWindowLongPtrW`
//! calls against `GWLP_USERDATA` were scattered across three files
//! (`message_loop.rs`, `container.rs`, `renderer.rs`), each casting the
//! same `isize`-sized slot to a *different* type depending on which kind of
//! window it was reasoning about, with the invariant re-explained by hand
//! in a `SAFETY` comment at every call site. That is exactly the standards
//! audit's P0.2 finding: a single raw storage slot doing double duty as
//! both a `*mut Runtime` (on top-level windows) and a cached `COLORREF`
//! (on container/control windows), with nothing but comment discipline
//! stopping a future change from reading one kind of window's slot with
//! the other kind's accessor and getting a garbage pointer dereference or
//! a garbage color.
//!
//! [`RuntimeSlot`] and [`BackgroundColorSlot`] do not eliminate that
//! invariant — Win32 only gives every window one untyped slot, so nothing
//! can enforce statically which *kind* of window is holding which value —
//! but they do concentrate every access behind one function each, so the
//! invariant is documented and can be audited or changed in exactly one
//! place instead of at every call site, and every call site outside this
//! module becomes a plain, safe-looking function call instead of a
//! bespoke `unsafe` cast.
