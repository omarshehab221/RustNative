//! `Lifecycle::LowMemory`, as Windows reports it.
//!
//! A desktop process gets no low-memory *message*; what Windows offers is a
//! memory resource notification object, signalled while available physical
//! memory is low. A watcher thread waits on it and posts
//! [`WM_FRAMEWORK_LOW_MEMORY`] to the primary window, which delivers the
//! lifecycle event on the UI thread (flushing state first, like every
//! lifecycle point). The object stays signalled for as long as memory is
//! low, so after reporting once the watcher waits for the *high*-memory
//! object before it will report again — one event per episode, not a
//! stream.
