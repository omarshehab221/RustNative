//! What a UI Automation provider stands for — a node, or a virtual element
//! inside one — and how it reads that node's *current* state.
//!
//! A provider never caches a node's semantics. Assistive technology can
//! hold an element for as long as it likes, and the component tree
//! re-renders underneath it, so every property read and every pattern
//! call resolves the target afresh through the window's `Runtime`. A target
//! whose node (or element) no longer exists answers
//! `UIA_E_ELEMENTNOTAVAILABLE`, which is UI Automation's contract for
//! exactly that situation.
