//! The escape hatch on Windows: a node's `HWND`, under the contract in
//! `framework_core::handle`.
//!
//! Every native object this backend creates is recorded here — its window,
//! its `HWND`, and a generation that changes whenever the object for that
//! node is destroyed or recreated — by the object registry itself, so the
//! table cannot disagree with what exists. It is thread-local, like every
//! `HWND` this crate owns, and reading it never touches a `Runtime`, so it
//! is safe to call from inside a component's render.
