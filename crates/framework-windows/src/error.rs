//! The platform-level error type this backend's `Platform::Error` resolves
//! to, and the native context it carries.
//!
//! # What this closes
//!
//! The standards audit's P2.32 finding is that a failed Win32 call used to
//! be reduced to two fields — an operation name and a `GetLastError` code —
//! and everything else about *where* it happened was discarded:
//!
//! > That is useful, but production diagnostics would benefit from:
//! > HRESULT where applicable; Win32 error category; window ID; node ID;
//! > native handle when safe to report; service operation; contextual
//! > source error.
//!
//! A bare "`CreateWindowExW(BUTTON)` failed with error code 8" tells an
//! application author that *something* failed to create, not which node in
//! which window, and gives them nothing to correlate against their own
//! logs. [`NativeContext`] carries that, and [`Win32Category`] turns the
//! raw code into a class of failure an application can actually branch on
//! (retry on a resource exhaustion, report a bug on an invalid parameter)
//! without hard-coding Win32 numerics at its own call sites.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! Raw handles are recorded for `Debug` but never rendered by `Display`, as
//! the audit asks ("do not expose raw OS handles in `Display`, but keep
//! them available to debug diagnostics"). A handle value is meaningless to
//! a person reading an error message and is a detail of an in-process
//! allocation table.
//!
//! `thiserror` is not used, though the audit names it as one option. This
//! crate's error surface is a single enum with hand-written `Display`
//! arms; a derive macro would add a proc-macro dependency to a backend
//! whose dependency list is otherwise deliberately minimal, in exchange for
//! removing about forty lines of entirely mechanical code. The layering the
//! audit actually asks for — structured context, a category, a source
//! chain — is present either way, and `std::error::Error::source` is
//! implemented by hand below.
