//! The headless reference backend.
//!
//! `PLAN.md` 2.13 caps what can be verified at the hardware in front of the
//! project. A headless backend lifts most of that cap for everything above
//! the realization layer (Milestone 45): it realizes the tree into an
//! inspectable model — through the same [`framework_core::TreeSnapshot`]
//! and [`framework_core::TreeDiff`] a native backend consumes, laid out with
//! deterministic metrics ([`HeadlessMeasurer`]) — and drives it with
//! synthetic input that travels the real input path.
//!
//! It is a backend in its own right, not a mock: it implements
//! [`framework_core::Platform`] ([`HeadlessPlatform`]), answers capabilities
//! honestly, and is the second backend the conformance suites of
//! Milestone 41 run against.
//!
//! | Item | For |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`HeadlessApp`] | driving an application: click, type, tab, scroll, advance time, restart |
//! | [`Query`] | finding nodes by role, accessible name, text, or label (`C60`) |
//! | [`HeadlessTree`] | the realized model, and its golden description |
//! | [`assert_golden!`] | comparing realized output against a reviewed file |
//! | [`MockHttp`] | scripted HTTP with expectations, checked by exhaustive mode (`C11`) |
//! | [`HeadlessPlatform`] | running an [`framework_core::Application`] with no host at all |
