//! What each backend owes the style model (`PLAN.md` 2.14 and Milestone
//! 58, "What each backend owes"): a capability answer for every property,
//! and a unit mapping.
//!
//! The tables live here, beside the vocabulary, so that the one answer is
//! read in three places: the backend's `Platform::style_capabilities`, the
//! `classes!`/`styles!` macros (an unavailable property fails the build for
//! that target, at the class that set it), and the conformance test that
//! holds the Windows table against what the backend actually applies.
