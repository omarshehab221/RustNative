//! `rustnative`, the Rust Native command.
//!
//! ```text
//! rustnative new <name> --syntax builder|markup [--path DIR] [--framework-path DIR]
//! rustnative build <platform> [--release]
//! rustnative run   <platform> [--release]
//! rustnative check [platform]
//! rustnative test  [-- cargo test arguments]
//! rustnative package <platform> [--format zip|msix|all] [--sign CERT --password-env VAR]

//! rustnative lsp [--server rust-analyzer]
//! ```
//!
//! `rustnative` **orchestrates** the toolchains rather than replacing them: a build
//! is Cargo's build, with Cargo's own output, and the Windows SDK tools are
//! found where they are installed rather than bundled. Platforms whose
//! backend the roadmap has not reached are recognized and refused by name,
//! with the milestone that will bring them — never quietly built for
//! Windows instead.
//!
//! A project is a folder with a `rustnative.toml` (see [`config`]), which holds
//! the identity the application's saved state, single-instance mutex, and
//! package are keyed by.
