//! Surfaces beyond the main window (`PLAN.md` Milestone 57): a tray or
//! menu-bar extra, a jump list, progress on the taskbar icon, and
//! notifications from them — asked for through [`Surfaces`], realized by
//! each backend that has them (`Capability::Surface`), and answered by
//! [`crate::Event::SurfaceAction`].
//!
//! ```
//! use framework_core::surfaces::{SurfaceCommand, Surfaces, TrayMenuItem};
//!
//! let surfaces = Surfaces::default();
//! surfaces.show_tray("Notes", vec![TrayMenuItem::new("new", "New note"), TrayMenuItem::new("quit", "Quit")]);
//! surfaces.set_progress(Some(0.4));
//! // The backend takes what was asked for after each change.
//! assert!(matches!(surfaces.take()[..], [SurfaceCommand::ShowTray { .. }, SurfaceCommand::Progress(Some(_))]));
//! ```
//!
//! A choice in the tray menu arrives as `Event::SurfaceAction` with the
//! item's id; a click on the icon with the action `"activate"`; a click on
//! a notification with `"notification"`. Each goes to the primary window's
//! root component, as a menu choice does.
