//! Showing a list of a hundred thousand items with a screenful of native
//! objects.
//!
//! # What virtualization is here
//!
//! A virtual list is **not a second list runtime**. It is an ordinary
//! container node ([`crate::Node::virtual_list`] builds a scrollable
//! [`Column`](crate::Node::column) or [`Row`](crate::Node::row)) carrying
//! one extra piece of information: how many items it *logically* has. Its
//! children are the window of items currently realized, each tagged with
//! its item index by [`Node::with_item_index`](crate::Node::with_item_index).
//! Everything else — identity, diffing, layout, native object recycling,
//! scrolling, accessibility — is the machinery that was already there.
//!
//! ```text
//!   item_count: 100_000          the list says how long it is
//!          │
//!          ▼
//!   ExtentCache                  where each item starts, measured or estimated
//!          │
//!          ▼
//!   VirtualRange::compute        which items the viewport needs right now
//!          │
//!          ▼
//!   Event::VisibleRangeChanged   the component renders that window of items
//! ```
//!
//! # What scrolling costs
//!
//! Scrolling inside a range costs nothing: the backend moves the container's
//! content window and no component is asked for anything (see
//! `framework_windows::native::rendering::scrolling`). Only crossing a range
//! boundary reaches the component, as one
//! [`Event::VisibleRangeChanged`](crate::Event::VisibleRangeChanged), and
//! only the items that entered or left the range are inserted or removed.
//! On Windows those insertions reuse the native windows the removals freed,
//! so a list scrolled from end to end creates a screenful of controls once.
//!
//! # Placement, padding, and gaps
//!
//! Items are laid end to end from the list's content origin, each at
//! [`ExtentCache::offset_of`] along the list's axis and filling it across.
//! A virtual list therefore ignores the container padding and gap an
//! ordinary column would apply: those would have to be folded into every
//! offset computation and every hit test, and an item that wants space
//! around it can simply include it. [`crate::Node::virtual_list`] builds a
//! container style with neither, so what is drawn matches what is
//! computed.
