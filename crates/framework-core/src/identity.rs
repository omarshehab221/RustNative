//! Stable identity primitives.
//!
//! This module is deliberately small and self-contained: every other module
//! that needs a framework identity (components, nodes, windows, tasks)
//! depends on it, but it depends on nothing else in the crate. That makes it
//! the natural place to enforce the single invariant the rest of the
//! reconciliation pipeline is built on — **two different declarative keys
//! must never resolve to the same [`NodeId`]** — in one location instead of
//! scattered across reconciliation code.
//!
//! # Why interning, not hashing
//!
//! An earlier design derived [`NodeId::from_key`] from an FNV-1a hash of the
//! key string. A hash digest is compact and stateless, but it is
//! fundamentally a many-to-one mapping: the pigeonhole principle guarantees
//! that *some* pair of distinct strings collides onto the same 64-bit value,
//! even though a real collision is astronomically unlikely for any one
//! application. That residual risk is exactly the kind of thing a framework
//! should design away rather than accept, especially since a collision would
//! silently merge two logically distinct UI nodes into one identity —
//! corrupting native object reuse and event routing without ever raising an
//! error a developer could act on.
//!
//! [`NodeId::from_key`] therefore uses a true interning table keyed by exact
//! string equality instead. Distinct strings are *always* assigned distinct
//! integers — there is no hash, so there is no collision to worry about,
//! full stop. The cost is that the table must be retained for the life of
//! the process (an id, once assigned, can never be reused for a different
//! key, which is what gives the "never collides" guarantee its teeth) and
//! that interning is a call into shared, thread-local state rather than a
//! pure function of the bytes. Both costs are well worth paying: keys are
//! expected to be a small, stable, developer-authored vocabulary (the same
//! assumption React, `SwiftUI`, and similar frameworks make about `key`/`id`),
//! not a per-render-unique value, so the table stays small in practice.
//!
//! # Why component-scoped, not globally unique
//!
//! A single interned key is only unique among *other keys*, not among every
//! node any component in the application might ever create — two unrelated,
//! independently reusable components are still allowed to each use the
//! ordinary key `"submit"`. `NodeId::scoped` combines an interned local key
//! with the owning [`ComponentId`] to produce the identity a platform
//! backend actually sees, so reuse across components can never alias either:
//! the upper bits carry the component identity (itself an allocator that can
//! never repeat a live value — see `ComponentId::next`) and the lower bits
//! carry the interned, collision-free local key.
