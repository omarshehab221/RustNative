//! Time-based animation: what can animate, how it moves, and the timeline
//! that turns declarations into per-frame values.
//!
//! # Animation is not a rerender
//!
//! `PLAN.md`'s animation milestone states the constraint this module is
//! built around: *"Animations must not turn into full component rerenders
//! on every frame. Frame updates should target only the native properties
//! that need to change."*
//!
//! So an animation never touches component state. A [`Timeline`] holds the
//! running animations for one window, is advanced by a frame signal, and
//! produces [`Frame`]s — "this node's opacity is now 0.4" — that a backend
//! applies directly to native objects. The declarative tree is untouched
//! from the first frame to the last.
//!
//! # Two ways to animate
//!
//! - **Transitions** are declarative: a node says *how* a property should
//!   move ([`Node::with_transition`](crate::Node::with_transition)), and
//!   whenever a render changes that property the backend animates from the
//!   value currently on screen to the new one. Interrupting an in-flight
//!   transition retargets it from where it is now, so a value never jumps.
//! - **Explicit animations** are imperative: a component asks for one
//!   through [`ComponentContext::animations`](crate::ComponentContext::animations)
//!   and can cancel it by node and property. They belong to the component
//!   that started them and are cancelled when it unmounts, exactly like
//!   tasks.
//!
//! # Time comes from outside
//!
//! [`Timeline::tick`] is *given* the current time rather than reading a
//! clock, and a [`FrameClock`] supplies it at runtime. That is what makes
//! every behavior here — easing curves, spring settling, retargeting,
//! repeats — testable without waiting for real frames (see
//! [`ManualFrameClock`]).
//!
//! # Reduced motion
//!
//! A person who has asked their system for less motion gets it: with
//! [`MotionPreference::Reduced`], a transition completes on its first
//! frame, and an explicit animation does whatever its
//! [`ReducedMotion`] says.
