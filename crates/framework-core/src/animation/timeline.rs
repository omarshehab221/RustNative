//! The running animations of one window.
//!
//! A [`Timeline`] is pure logic over time: it is told when frames happen
//! and answers with the values each animated property should have. It
//! never reads a clock, touches a component, or knows what a native object
//! is — which is what lets a backend drive it from real frames and a test
//! drive it from a [`super::ManualFrameClock`] and get identical behavior.
//!
//! One property of one node has at most one animation at a time: starting
//! another *retargets* the running one from wherever it currently is, so an
//! interrupted animation never jumps. For a spring that also means the
//! motion keeps its direction, because the retarget starts from the
//! in-flight value rather than from the old endpoint.
