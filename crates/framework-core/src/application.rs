//! Multi-window orchestration: opening/closing windows, routing events and
//! task completions to the right window's [`ComponentTree`], and applying
//! deferred window-open/close requests queued by components (see
//! [`crate::component::WindowRequests`]).
//!
//! This is a distinct responsibility from [`crate::window`] (which owns
//! what a window *is* and its live state) and from [`crate::component`]
//! (which owns one window's tree in isolation): coordinating *several*
//! independent trees, each with their own scheduler and services handle, is
//! its own concern — see the standards audit's P1.21 finding on module
//! boundaries for why this split exists.
