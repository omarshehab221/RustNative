//! The host clock: the one place framework code reads "now".
//!
//! Time has two consumers in this crate that must agree: the scheduler,
//! whose delays already run on the executor's own notion of time
//! ([`crate::Executor::sleep`]), and everything that *compares* times — a
//! cache's freshness lifetime, a debounce, a retry backoff, a startup
//! phase. The second group used to have nothing to read but the operating
//! system's clock, which a test cannot move. [`Clock`] is the seam: code
//! that needs the current time asks the [`crate::Services`] it was given
//! for [`crate::Services::clock`], a backend supplies [`SystemClock`], and
//! a test supplies [`ManualClock`] — or a [`crate::ManualExecutor`], which
//! is a clock too, so one object moves both delays and timestamps.
//!
//! A clock reports a [`Duration`] since an arbitrary, fixed origin rather
//! than a wall-clock date: every consumer compares instants, and a
//! monotonic origin is what a date cannot promise.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! use framework_core::{Clock, ManualClock, Services};
//!
//! let clock = ManualClock::new();
//! let services = Services::default().with_clock(Arc::new(clock.clone()));
//!
//! let start = services.clock().now();
//! clock.advance(Duration::from_millis(1_500));
//! assert_eq!(services.clock().now() - start, Duration::from_millis(1_500));
//! ```
