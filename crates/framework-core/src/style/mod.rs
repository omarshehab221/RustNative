//! Theme and style resolution.
//!
//! - `theme`: the style model itself — colors, typography, per-kind and
//!   per-state defaults, the token table, and the merge that resolves them.
//! - `phase`: the two *phases* a node's styling passes through
//!   ([`StyleOverride`] before resolution, [`ResolvedStyle`] after), kept as
//!   distinct types so a backend cannot silently paint from the wrong one.
//! - [`decl`]: the second spelling of the same model (`PLAN.md` 2.14) — the
//!   declaration vocabulary and the utility classes above it, which
//!   `classes!`/`styles!` lower at compile time into a [`DeclarationSet`].
//! - `resolve`: folds a node's declarations into its typed properties
//!   against the theme's tokens and the environment, after every render and
//!   on every change to either.
//!
//! The two spellings are equal by construction: a declaration names exactly
//! one typed property, so `classes!("p-4 bg-blue-500")` and a builder chain
//! setting the same padding and background resolve to the same node.
