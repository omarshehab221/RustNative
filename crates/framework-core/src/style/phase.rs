//! The two phases a node's styling passes through, as distinct types.
//!
//! # Why these exist
//!
//! A node's appearance is described twice, and the two descriptions mean
//! very different things:
//!
//! 1. What the *application* asked for — a [`VisualStyle`] carrying only the
//!    properties it chose to override, with everything else left unset.
//! 2. What the node will actually *look like* — that override merged onto
//!    the active `Theme`'s default for the node's kind, in one specific
//!    [`ControlState`].
//!
//! Both used to be a bare `VisualStyle` sitting side by side in `TreeNode`,
//! distinguished only by field name and a doc comment. That is the standards
//! audit's P2.28 finding:
//!
//! > This is workable but makes semantic ownership unclear: which
//! > representation is authoritative for which phase? [...] make the phase
//! > boundary impossible to misunderstand.
//!
//! Comments cannot make it impossible. Types can: a backend that reaches for
//! the override where it needed the resolved style now fails to compile
//! instead of quietly painting a control with every themed property missing.
//!
//! # Why two types and not three
//!
//! The audit sketches three (`StyleOverride`, `ResolvedStyle`,
//! `InteractionResolvedStyle`). The third is not a different *shape* — an
//! interaction-resolved style is a resolved style; the only thing that
//! distinguishes it is which [`ControlState`] it was resolved for. So that
//! state is carried as data on [`ResolvedStyle`] rather than encoded as a
//! separate type. This is strictly more informative than a third newtype:
//! `resolved.state()` answers "hover or normal?" at runtime, which a type
//! could only answer at the definition site.
