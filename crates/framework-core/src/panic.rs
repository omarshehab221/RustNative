//! What an application does when a component panics.
//!
//! # Why this is a policy rather than a fixed behavior
//!
//! The standards audit's P2.33 finding is that this framework had two
//! inconsistent halves of an answer: the Windows backend catches panics at
//! its `WNDPROC` boundary (correct — unwinding across an `extern "system"`
//! frame is undefined behavior), while the core could still panic straight
//! through an `assert!` or `expect()`; and the caught half had exactly one
//! hard-coded response, terminate the application.
//!
//! > The production architecture should have a consistent application-level
//! > error/panic policy. [...] The policy should be configurable by the
//! > host.
//!
//! It should be configurable because the right answer is genuinely
//! different per application, and a framework cannot know which:
//!
//! - An editor with unsaved work would rather keep the window open on a
//!   panic in one panel than take the document down with it.
//! - A kiosk or a safety-adjacent tool wants the opposite: a component in an
//!   unknown state is a reason to stop, loudly and immediately.
//! - A test harness wants to observe the panic and keep going.
//!
//! # What a panic does and does not mean here
//!
//! A caught panic leaves the panicking component's own state arbitrary —
//! `update` may have mutated half its fields before unwinding. Every policy
//! other than [`PanicPolicy::Terminate`] is therefore a deliberate trade:
//! the application keeps running with one component whose invariants may not
//! hold. [`PanicPolicy::CloseWindow`] is the middle ground that bounds the
//! damage to a window whose whole tree can be discarded, which is why it is
//! the one this crate recommends for applications that do not want to exit.
//!
//! This is a policy about *panics*, which are bugs. Ordinary recoverable
//! failures are `Result`s — see [`crate::component::RenderError`] for where
//! this crate draws that line.
