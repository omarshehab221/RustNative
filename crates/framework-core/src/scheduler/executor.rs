//! A pluggable async execution backend.
//!
//! The standards audit's P1.7 finding is that `framework-core` originally
//! hard-wired every [`super::Scheduler`] to one process-global,
//! `OnceLock`-backed, always-exactly-two-worker-thread Tokio runtime: every
//! `Application` in a process shared one executor whether or not that was
//! appropriate, tests shared global runtime state with each other and with
//! any real application in the same process, and there was no way for an
//! embedding host to supply its own executor.
//!
//! [`Executor`] is the seam that fixes this: [`super::Scheduler`] spawns
//! through a `dyn Executor` it is handed at construction rather than a
//! hard-coded free function. [`TokioExecutor`] is the default
//! implementation and preserves the exact previous behavior (via
//! [`TokioExecutor::shared`], the same process-wide runtime that always
//! existed — this is a seam being introduced, not a behavior change for
//! existing callers), but a host can now construct its own `TokioExecutor`
//! with a different worker-count policy (see [`TokioExecutor::dedicated`]),
//! or provide an entirely different [`Executor`] implementation.
//!
//! # Time is part of the executor contract (P1.18)
//!
//! An earlier version of this seam spawned tasks through [`Executor`] but
//! still read delays directly from a hard-coded Tokio timer, so a component
//! that awaited a delay could never be tested deterministically no matter
//! which executor its `Scheduler` used. [`Executor::sleep`] closes that
//! gap: [`super::Scheduler::sleep`] (and, in turn,
//! `ComponentContext::sleep`/`EffectContext::sleep`) delegate to *that*
//! scheduler's own executor, not a global runtime. [`ManualExecutor`] is
//! the deterministic backend this unlocks — see its docs — and is the
//! recommended executor for any test that spawns tasks or awaits delays and
//! wants to assert on their outcome without racing a real clock or a real
//! thread pool.
