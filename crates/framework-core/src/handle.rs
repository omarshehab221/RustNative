//! The escape-hatch contract (`PLAN.md` 2.6, Milestone 39).
//!
//! 2.6 says an application must be able to reach the host object behind a
//! node when the portable model is not enough. This module is what that
//! means precisely:
//!
//! - **How it is obtained.** From the backend, by node id, on the UI thread
//!   ([`crate::affinity::UiThread`]): on Windows,
//!   `framework_windows::native_handle`. Nothing in `framework-core` hands
//!   one out, because nothing here knows a host.
//! - **What it is.** A [`NativeHandle`]: the raw host value (an `HWND`, an
//!   `NSView *`, a DOM element reference, as an integer), the node it
//!   belongs to, and the realization generation it was taken at.
//! - **What invalidates it.** The node's native object being destroyed —
//!   unmounted, or recreated because its kind changed. The generation
//!   changes when that happens, so a stale handle is detectable rather than
//!   a dangling pointer. Re-rendering with the same identity does *not*
//!   invalidate it (2.7: native objects are reused while identity is stable).
//! - **What the application may do.** Call host APIs that read the object
//!   or change what the framework does not own: custom drawing on a
//!   surface, host-only properties the portable model has no word for, a
//!   subclass that observes messages. It must not destroy the object,
//!   re-parent it, or change properties the framework applies (text,
//!   enabled state, geometry, style) — the next render would overwrite
//!   them, and the framework's bookkeeping would disagree with the host.
//! - **What the framework guarantees afterwards.** It keeps managing the
//!   object exactly as before, never caches anything the application might
//!   have changed behind its back, and destroys the object on the normal
//!   rules.
//!
//! The states a handle passes through are types (`C21`): a handle is taken
//! [`Unchecked`], and only [`NativeHandle::validate`] — which compares the
//! generation against the backend's current one — yields a [`Live`] handle,
//! the only kind whose raw value can be read.
