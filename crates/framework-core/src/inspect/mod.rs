//! Inspection and diagnostics (`PLAN.md` Milestone 44): one protocol the
//! runtime answers, whatever the backend.
//!
//! A compiled framework does not inherit introspection from a runtime, so
//! it exposes its own. The protocol covers the declarative tree and the
//! components that produced it, the realized host objects and the mapping
//! between the two, component state (readable, and editable where a
//! component says how — see [`crate::Component::edit`]), a per-node
//! explanation of layout and of style provenance, event and render tracing
//! with every component's render-or-skip reason, tasks, host-object
//! lifetimes, capabilities and what was refused, active mapper
//! customizations, state history, and recording.
//!
//! [`crate::Application::inspect`] answers a [`Request`]; what only the
//! backend knows (its objects, their rectangles, its capability tables)
//! comes through [`InspectBackend`]. [`InspectServer`] carries requests
//! over loopback TCP (or any address the host binds explicitly) as
//! line-delimited JSON, authenticated by a per-process token; the
//! `rustnative inspect` client speaks it. [`compact`] is the reduced form
//! for targets with no second screen: numeric message ids and arguments,
//! formatted on the host side.
//!
//! ```
//! use framework_core::inspect::{NoBackend, Reply, Request};
//! use framework_core::{Application, Component, Event, Node, Size, Window};
//!
//! struct Counter(u32);
//! impl Component for Counter {
//!     type Props = ();
//!     type Message = u32;
//!     fn new((): ()) -> Self { Self(0) }
//!     fn props(&self) -> &() { &() }
//!     fn set_props(&mut self, (): ()) {}
//!     fn view(&self) -> Node { Node::label("count", format!("{}", self.0)) }
//!     fn update(&mut self, _: Event) {}
//!     fn message(&mut self, value: u32) { self.0 = value; }
//!     fn inspect(&self) -> Option<serde_json::Value> { Some(serde_json::json!({ "count": self.0 })) }
//!     fn edit(&self, field: &str, value: &serde_json::Value) -> Option<u32> {
//!         (field == "count").then(|| value.as_u64()).flatten().and_then(|v| u32::try_from(v).ok())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut app = Application::new(Counter(0), Window::new("Counter", Size::new(200, 100)));
//! let path = app.components().inspect_components()[0].path.clone();
//! let edit = Request::SetState { path, field: "count".into(), value: 7.into(), window: None };
