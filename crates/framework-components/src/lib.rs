//! The component library (`PLAN.md` Milestone 48): what applications are
//! built from, above the native primitives.
//!
//! - [`behaviour`]: the headless behaviour layer — focus, keyboard, and
//!   selection for lists, tabs, menus, trees, grids, comboboxes, and date
//!   entry, independent of appearance (`C19`);
//! - [`widgets`]: the composite components, each a component usable as a
//!   builder call and as a markup element, bound to its parent through
//!   stores and commands;
//! - [`chart`]: line, area, bar, scatter, and pie charts on the draw-list
//!   path, each with an accessible data table;
//! - [`idioms`]: the per-host idiom table (`C23`);
//! - the role tokens every style is written against, and
//!   [`with_roles`] to supply them.
//!
//! The guide is `docs/components.md`; the tokens are `docs/tokens.md`.
