//! Constrained background work (`PLAN.md` Milestone 47): jobs that wait
//! for the network, for external power, or until a deadline — the
//! contract both mobile hosts impose on background work, stated portably.
//!
//! On a desktop there is no scheduler outside the process for an ordinary
//! application: work runs while the application runs, when its constraints
//! hold. The host answers the constraints through [`Conditions`] — on
//! Windows, `framework_windows::WindowsConditions` asks the power and
//! network APIs.
