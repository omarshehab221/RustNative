//! The application data layer (`PLAN.md` Milestone 47): what an
//! application does between its UI and its host.
//!
//! - [`query`]: cached, deduplicated, revalidated asynchronous data, with
//!   pagination and batching;
//! - [`mutation`]: optimistic changes with rollback, and an offline queue
//!   with a conflict policy;
//! - [`forms`]: one validation model for client and server, with a
//!   changeset, per-field errors, and a submission lifecycle;
//! - [`migrate`]: versioned persisted state, migrated up and down;
//! - [`history`]: undo and redo;
//! - [`machine`]: state machines whose states own their work;
//! - [`operation`]: long-running operations with progress and cancellation;
//! - [`work`]: background work under network, power, and deadline
//!   constraints;
//! - [`table`]: live queries over local storage, and a gap-filling paging
//!   source;
//! - [`http`]: an interceptor chain and declared endpoints;
//! - [`image`]: image loading with decode, downscale, and caches.
//!
//! Shared state, error boundaries, supervision, and streams are in
//! `framework-core` ([`framework_core::state`], [`framework_core::component::boundary`],
//! [`framework_core::scheduler`]), because every component can use them.
//! The guide is `docs/data.md`.
