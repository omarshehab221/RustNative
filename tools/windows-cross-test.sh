# Compiles and runs this workspace's real `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target on a
# Linux host that has no `rustup` and no network access to
# static.rust-lang.org (only a distro-packaged rustc/cargo and crates.io) —
# and then actually *executes* the resulting Win32 binaries under Wine,
# rather than only type-checking them.
#
# # Why this exists
#
# `framework-windows`'s `native` module is `#[cfg(windows)]`-gated, so a
# plain `cargo check --workspace` on Linux excludes it entirely — it has
# never, in this project's history, been compiled by anything running on a
# non-Windows host. `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` doesn't
# help either: the distro's rustc ships a prebuilt standard library only for
# its own host target, not for `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, and the normal way
# to get one (`rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`) needs network
# access to `static.rust-lang.org`, which is not always available.
#
# This script routes around both problems:
#
#   1. `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1` makes a *stable* rustc/cargo accept nightly-only
#      flags, including `-Z build-std`, which compiles `core`/`alloc`/`std`
#      from source against whatever target you ask for instead of requiring
#      a prebuilt one.
#   2. The matching library source is fetched directly from `rust-lang/rust`
#      on GitHub at the exact tag matching the installed rustc's version,
#      confirmed against the installed rustc's own reported commit hash —
#      plus its `library/backtrace` submodule, fetched separately at the
#      pinned commit `rust-lang/rust`'s `.gitmodules` records for it, since
#      a plain sparse checkout does not pull submodules.
#   3. The two small "Rust runtime startup object" files a real Windows link
#      normally needs (`rsbegin.o`/`rsend.o` — see
#      `library/rtstartup/*.rs`) aren't produced by `-Z build-std` itself
#      (they're bootstrap-specific build steps), so this script compiles
#      them directly with `rustc --emit=obj` and drops them into the
#      sysroot's target `lib/` directory, where the linker's default search
#      path picks them up.
#   4. `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`/`-ld` (from `gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64`) do the
#      actual linking, exactly as they would for any other Rust
#      `windows-gnu` cross-compilation setup.
#   5. The resulting PE32+ binaries are run under Wine. With an Xvfb virtual
#      display available (`DISPLAY` pointing at it), Wine's real X11 driver
#      loads and actual `CreateWindowExW` calls succeed — not just
#      `cargo test`'s non-`#[cfg(windows)]` subset, but real native window
#      creation, menu realization, and control layout, executed and,
#      running headed under Xvfb, screenshot-able.
#
# This is a genuinely new verification capability for this codebase, not a
# replacement for real Windows CI (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — Wine is
# not Windows, and differences between the two are exactly the kind of thing
# this technique cannot catch. Treat a pass here as "compiles, links, and
# behaves plausibly under Wine", and a real Windows CI run as the actual
# release gate.
#
# # Usage
#   tools/windows-cross-test.sh              # build + cargo test under wine
#   tools/windows-cross-test.sh --run-example  # also launch hello-label
#                                               # under Xvfb and screenshot it
#
# # Requirements (all installed via apt in this project's dev environment)
#   - gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 (provides x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc/-ld)
#   - wine, wine64
#   - xvfb, imagemagick (only for --run-example's screenshot)
#   - git (for the sparse/partial clones below)
#   - network access to github.com/codeload.github.com (to fetch the
#     matching library source) and crates.io (for this workspace's own
#     dependencies) — NOT to static.rust-lang.org.
